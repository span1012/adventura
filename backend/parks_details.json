We didn\u2019t know what to expect but found everything accessible, easy and walkable with a variety of slides and water features and extra entertainment at the water park. The free soda, ice and water was a huge plus on a hot day. We got here at opening and also got chairs under the umbrella for shade. They will fill up so go early or rent a cabana. The park was very clean and the staff was great! I would definitely come back to try the amusement park side next time. We give this place two thumbs up.",

Parking was free, discounts for purchasing our tickets on line was a plus, free drinks all day. Well placed sunscreen stations, lots of shady areas for those of us who can't do sun was a welcome plus. After  being given all the free extras, We gladly paid $30 for a pizza that was giagiantic and fed all 6 of us. Rides, shows and wave pools were some of the highlights. Plenty to do and I must say from the entrance to the exit the place was neat and Tidy. We got there at the opening and it wasn't crowded but as the afternoon progressed it did fill up.\nA fun day and a definite place to tell my friends about.

We walked in for my nieces 10th birthday party last night, only to be jumping for 10 minutes before a disgusting and vile fight broke out between a ton of adults who also involved their children in the fight. This fight went on for over 15 minutes before security, any of the employees, or police stepped in! Fighting and cussing and being disgusting right in the front lobby in front of all of the staff who were blatantly ignoring them and subjecting every child there to this trauma. When my family member asked for a refund for the $500 birthday party she just paid for, the staff refused and only agreed to partially refund her her money. They made her pay for jump socks and 4 pizzas that we weren\u2019t even able to utilize and still kept over $200 of her money! Everyone who checked in at 5pm were forcibly removed from the premises, but if you had reservations at 7pm or later, you were allowed to come back and jump. My niece\u2019s entire birthday party ruined for some ghetto disgusting fighting. Even more disgusting that all the staff and security just stood there watching a huge fist fight break out in their lobby in front of all these children! You will NEVER get my money again dirty fun city. Do not send your children here they are not safe!!!",

The staff at the front told my guests that they needed to check in with the host in the party room and would get their socks at that time. Every time we would have to hunt down a host who then needed to go and find our host. They never asked what size socks the kids needed just gave them some and left the room. My guests had to go back upfront to get a different size because they gave them all small. They only provide one juice or one water per jumper. So if parents want something to drink they charge you $2.00 for a water and because we went on a weekend they charged $2.50. Their website says that the host will help with set up, service and clean up. They did not do any of that. While we were doing cake a host come in the room and took the utensil/plate/napkin hold her. I advised that we were not done and they responded with \u201cI\u2019m taking it to refill it\u201d. It was returned after we got done. While picking up the room a staff member come in and asked who to give the bill to. While we were carrying things out someone else come in and asked us if we were using the card on file to pay the bill. They then walked me to the front counter to make sure we paid.\n\nVery poor customer service. Would not recommend having a party here.",

The staff at the front told my guests that they needed to check in with the host in the party room and would get their socks at that time. Every time we would have to hunt down a host who then needed to go and find our host. They never asked what size socks the kids needed just gave them some and left the room. My guests had to go back upfront to get a different size because they gave them all small. They only provide one juice or one water per jumper. So if parents want something to drink they charge you $2.00 for a water and because we went on a weekend they charged $2.50. Their website says that the host will help with set up, service and clean up. They did not do any of that. While we were doing cake a host come in the room and took the utensil/plate/napkin hold her. I advised that we were not done and they responded with \u201cI\u2019m taking it to refill it\u201d. It was returned after we got done. While picking up the room a staff member come in and asked who to give the bill to. While we were carrying things out someone else come in and asked us if we were using the card on file to pay the bill. They then walked me to the front counter to make sure we paid.\n\nVery poor customer service. Would not recommend having a party here.",

This is a area for kids 10 and under. They also have different structures and wall structures to climb with a adventure course. This area also says for kids 10 and under. They have a foam pit you can jump in. A trampoline dodge ball area,basket ball area. Various trampolines and a foam pit obstacle courses and a small zip line going over one foam pit. The arcade they have costs extra and is not included\nThey have some massage chairs you have to pay for to sit at. Also various metal benches you can sit on. Definitely a place to check out. My kids loved it. They have ample parking this is located in a shopping plaza area.",

I will say the people working the theme park were far more friendly and upbeat than the workers in the water park. I did appreciate the amount of lifeguards around the water! It was a chilly Spring morning and we were nervous walking into the park but the second we stepped inside it felt like the Tropics!! So nice and warm, it was perfect temp. Bathrooms and changing rooms were very clean. The pizza was delicious and the drink cups were a good value. When I asked if we could bring back our cups next visit to recharge them for another day the worker said he wasn\u2019t sure. Would be great if we can bring them back next visit to recharge for the day at discounted rate! We had not been to the water park as the price was too steep for our family, but the neighbor family 4pk pass was an excellent value we couldn\u2019t pass up! Looking forward to more visits this year!!",

So we paid for an unlimited pass that didn\u2019t include 5 of the \u2018rides\u2019. The gamer pass only lets you play arcade games but not accumulate tickets (which is half of the fun). The roller coaster only runs every 10 minutes. All the exceptions are really a turn-off. Overall, the kids had fun (except for the Fun House which was scary for my 7 and 8 year old and more like a haunted house). The mini golf courses were solid with lots of decor to add interest.",

We used to come to just the amusement park all the time and that part looked pretty run down. We went to buy tickets for the Winter Wonderland part and we\u2019re very disappointed were told that even though as her parents we wouldn\u2019t be participating in the snow slide or bouncy castles we still had to pay for a full price ticket. They made you take the train around to get in which just took us in a big circle and when that wasn\u2019t necessary. They told us she would be able to do the slide for 15min or 20min. Even on the unlimited you only got a few minutes before being kicked out of that area and would have to go all the way out and take the train again to play on that again. We chose to get the 1 time pass instead however I timed it from the time we got off the train to the time that they told us we had to leave that area and it was exactly 6min 32sec. That gave my daughter time to only slide 2 times and there was about 20 people on the train we took. If there were anymore we may have only gotten her on 1 time. No where near 15 which we told was the minimum time. We could go to the bounce area and play for as long as we wanted however there are no bathrooms for portapotties in the fenced off area. You have to leave to go and if you don\u2019t have an unlimited pass they would not let us back in if we left to use it. And the unlimited passes would have to take the train to get back in. Even if you have an older kid they would not allow them to go in by themselves selves. It was basically a way to get a lot of money and provide very little. If they are going to make everyone pay then you would think that they would also have something that you could do/play with your kids and at the very least restrooms or access to one without having to leave. One things for sure we will not be going back and I suggest you don\u2019t either. I have included pics so you can see how small the snow slide is. The workers also had their family there and their kids who were \u201chelping\u201d and able to play and slide as much as they wanted. They were rude at the ticket counter and lied about the time you would get to get your money. That\u2019s all they cared about. This the season. So sad.",

The amusement park is connected to a nearby network of parks and recreation centers geared for all ages. The park is free to enter. The cost of rides can really add up for a larger family. We did not attend when there were any discounts but it looks like they offer them frequently. There is plenty of things to do and see in the area to make leisurely afternoon of it.",

                "text": "Last weekend, we had an absolute blast meeting up with friends and family for a night of mini golf! As soon as we approached the entrance, we were greeted by the sight of a massive castle adorned with vibrant neon lights. It set the perfect mood for an evening filled with fun and laughter. The air was electric with the sounds of arcade games all around us, including some of the beloved classics that sparked happy nostalgia for many in our group.\n\nDespite the bustling atmosphere, we made our way to the back to grab our golf clubs. There was a sense of excitement in the air as we prepared for our adventure on the course. We opted for the full 18 holes since we had a large crew, and honestly, I can\u2019t think of a better way to bond and challenge each other than some friendly competition.\n\nAs we stepped onto the course, I noticed it was in great shape! Some reviews had mentioned issues, but we found everything to be tidy and well-maintained, aside from a few stray leaves,  which was perfectly understandable given the season. Each hole presented unique obstacles and creative designs that kept us on our toes and added a fun twist to the game. From tricky slopes to whimsical decorations, every play was a new adventure and a chance for a laugh.\n\nThe excitement was palpable as we all took turns, cheering each other on and playfully teasing those who missed easy putts! At one point, we even had a spontaneous dance-off between holes. I\u2019m pretty sure the other players must have thought we were a bit wild, but who could blame us? The energy was infectious!\n\nOverall, it was an evening filled with joy, laughter, and maybe a few friendly rivalries. As the final scores were tallied, we were already making plans to come back for another round. If you\u2019re looking for an entertaining night out with friends or family, this mini golf spot is a winner. We had such a fantastic time, and I can\u2019t wait for our next adventure there!",

It was roughly 16$ per person for one round and it took us about an hour or so. It's right off the interstate. A few holes a ball would get stuck and you could tell it was a problem so they really need to fix some of that. Birds are all over, and their poop. But very pretty trees!

I spent a lot of money, and me and my kids waited for every single attraction over 15 min , and we were the only ones in line. When we came in we asked about the arcade add on but she did not know how to do it. Then my kid lost his golf ball wanted a certain color, and couldn\u2019t get it. So I could have spent more money but. I did not. And I won\u2019t be coming back.

                "text": "I have been taking my son here for the last 3 years and he still loves it! The illumination train is my favorite it's so fun! There are lots of different light displays with great music and it's a decently long (but not too long) ride too. The lady working at the train is awesome, she has so much energy and she even got my son and a few other kids out dancing with her while waiting in line for the next train. The food is kind of expensive, I paid $8 for a small cup of Mac n cheese and my son was still hungry after so ended up spending another $12 I think for funnel cake. At least it was good food. If you want to see Santa I suggest getting there right when they open. Last year we got there before they opened and the line was still really long but this year we got there 15 minutes after opening and the wait was already 1 hour long which is way too long for a 5 year old boy to stand in one place doing nothing and it stayed that way the rest of the night so the last 2 years we missed out on seeing Santa. I think that's the one thing they could improve on especially considering that's probably a big part of the reason people go. Feeding the reindeer is another favorite but I suggest going to do that sooner than later as they seem to get full or less interested in taking food from the kids later in the evening. Bathrooms are decent and seem to be kept up with pretty well. If you are looking for a place to have some Holiday fun Christmas at Schnepf Farms should be on your list!",

My only negative thing to say is that it is still pretty pricey. Most things to do a \u201cpay per event\u201d type thing. So your admission cost doesn\u2019t cover most things.

It can get hot and exhausting to hike up and down the hills in the theme park. I definitely enjoyed it more when the water park was open. It\u2019s still hot in October and we would have appreciated the cool down. Season passes are a fabulous deal! They pay for themselves in less than 2 visits. Plus you can bring guests for a discount and even bring guests for free at certain times. Well worth the cost of the pass. The food is priced so high that it\u2019s almost ridiculous.

(I'm new to needing a wheelchair.)\nWe didn't know the wheel chairs and electric wheelchairs would sell out (you can purchase in advance online).\n\nWe tried our luck as we entered. Nothing. So I stayed near the carousel until about an hour and a half until closing when someone turned in their rental.\n\nI politely asked to speak to a supervisor, I asked for a discounted rate since it was such a short time, but the supervisor said it was not possible to offer any discounts.\n\nSo let me break it down a bit. The electric wheelchairs are $55 plus tax, coming out to $62 total. (at the Oakland zoo for example the are only $30)\n\nIt literally feels like and did cost me double what it costs an able bodied person to not ride anything but the stardeck.\nHad I gotten the chance to rent the entire time, it would have come out to $10 per hour.\n\nI ask that Great America look into its policy and evaluate their customer service.

The train wasn't even working. A nice (free!) playground is 100x better. At least there's stuff to do in a playground. The talking boxes scattered around don't have buttons, but rather they require a \"magic key\" to be inserted which costs $3 to buy. The audacity to charge even more just to listen to the boxes. And then they even ask for them back once you exit the park!\n\nI'm shocked this place still exists. Are we all so desensitized to being ripped off? People, just let it go and stop coming here.

These are small carnival rides and indoor playgrounds usually charge $12/kid (adults are free) and the kids have way more to do than this place. The \"rideshare\" program makes the experience even worse since you have to wait long times to ride rides due to the lack of staff. The staff are constantly on breaks, inefficient rotations of rides, lots of them just wander around and don't appear to even be working. With that said, they are VERY nice and great with the kids. Back to the cost...I expect more for the amount we paid. Are they putting money back into the business? Rides are falling apart, you can tell where they \"rig\" something up just to make it limp along. Hopefully nothing bad happens/falls apart and a kid gets hurt. Food/snacks are way overpriced for what you get. The nacho cheese was cold and literally turned solid on the chips within minutes.",

                "text": "Last weekend, we had an absolute blast meeting up with friends and family for a night of mini golf! As soon as we approached the entrance, we were greeted by the sight of a massive castle adorned with vibrant neon lights. It set the perfect mood for an evening filled with fun and laughter. The air was electric with the sounds of arcade games all around us, including some of the beloved classics that sparked happy nostalgia for many in our group.\n\nDespite the bustling atmosphere, we made our way to the back to grab our golf clubs. There was a sense of excitement in the air as we prepared for our adventure on the course. We opted for the full 18 holes since we had a large crew, and honestly, I can\u2019t think of a better way to bond and challenge each other than some friendly competition.\n\nAs we stepped onto the course, I noticed it was in great shape! Some reviews had mentioned issues, but we found everything to be tidy and well-maintained, aside from a few stray leaves,  which was perfectly understandable given the season. Each hole presented unique obstacles and creative designs that kept us on our toes and added a fun twist to the game. From tricky slopes to whimsical decorations, every play was a new adventure and a chance for a laugh.\n\nThe excitement was palpable as we all took turns, cheering each other on and playfully teasing those who missed easy putts! At one point, we even had a spontaneous dance-off between holes. I\u2019m pretty sure the other players must have thought we were a bit wild, but who could blame us? The energy was infectious!\n\nOverall, it was an evening filled with joy, laughter, and maybe a few friendly rivalries. As the final scores were tallied, we were already making plans to come back for another round. If you\u2019re looking for an entertaining night out with friends or family, this mini golf spot is a winner. We had such a fantastic time, and I can\u2019t wait for our next adventure there!",

I spent a lot of money, and me and my kids waited for every single attraction over 15 min , and we were the only ones in line. When we came in we asked about the arcade add on but she did not know how to do it. Then my kid lost his golf ball wanted a certain color, and couldn\u2019t get it. So I could have spent more money but. I did not. And I won\u2019t be coming back.

The entrance used to be in the front, but the new back entrance has ample parking. I love the new suspension bridge. The price is GREAT!!! To visit for the day it's only $18 a person and children under two enter free. My grandchildren had a great time at the petting zoom and seeing all the different animals. The rides are definitely for younger children. I visited on a Sunday, and it wasn't overly crowded. We didn't have to wait more than 5 min to access each ride. The new trian was still under construction, so we didn't get to do the whole tour. Definitely recommend this place for a cheap, fun experience with younger children!!!",

I really appreciated their half price Wednesday deal.  The machines were not working but the staff handled it quickly and efficiently got us in.  We went after we did a visit to Storyland and the two parks really complement each other.\n\nI am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of the silly no outside food policy.  The park is geared for people with young children and everyone knows young children need lots of snacks! I assume Playland is hoping that people will buy their food but i actually think they are hurting themselves because families will leave the park in order to feed their children. The park offers a very limited menu of junk food and many family will not be able to find anything for their families to eat.\n\nFYI: the train is $3 (3 tokens/tickets) for each passenger. The games are 5 tickets each.  Don\u2019t buy the extra 10 tokens when you check in because I got stuck with 4 extra tokens on my wristband. Once inside, you can add a ticket at a time using one of the kiosks.\n\nWe are rooting for you Playland! Thanks for an awesome day!",

So much fun to do the rides at night! This place has grown and offers more rides than whe I was a kid and when my children were kids. I hear they'll be offering more reasonable prices and making efforts to save it. Great memories here for generations of my family. Highly recommended Playland!",

General admission tickets allow you to ride most rides in the park and have access to the water play area. Children ages 3 to 8 would thoroughly enjoy this park! The park is not crowded we were there on a Saturday from 10 :30 until 12:30 and never had to wait for rides . In fact we rode many of the rides alone and multiple times ! The park is clean and the staff is welcoming. A shout out to Jeannie working in the canoe area on Saturday the 8th. She worked very hard to get my grandson the Blue Canoe! Food is not allowed in the park. They are semi-strict about this. Parking is a bear because of the zoo. But parking is free. At least it was for us the day we visited for some reason.",

The park caters more to toddlers ages 2-5 to be safe. The rides are really nice for them, as well as the train ride around the park. The staff is very welcoming and friendly and a clean overall place for families with little ones. They also have a big area for parties as well as a small one that's optional too with plenty of shade on hot summer days.\n\nBe aware the prices are a bit high for the rides but you are allowed to use your tickets wherever you visit the park again, since there are no real expiration dates on them.\n\nSo I would recommend starting off with purchasing the smallest amount of tickets since any adult with their baby/toddler can ride free, you only have to pay one entry fee per ride and most rides are about 2-3 tickets per ride and there are only 6-7 rides there.\n\nParking is free, as well as entry.\nAlso if you don't want to eat the food there, just bring your own for your little ones, there are plenty of tables with shade for you to sit and eat at.",

The nice thing about the games is that you pay for the prize (i.e., $10 for a small blow-up microphone, plushies were quite a bit more) and your child plays until they win.

On some days characters will walk around and kids can take pics with them. Little red riding hood and Jack and Jill came out while we were there.\nThe price range is fair, $4 for kids up to age 10 and $6 for 11 and older. I do think all kids should be $4, honestly the older kids don't care for it but cost more, same for adults. Either way the price isn't bad. A season pass is $50, that gets 2 kids in and 2 adults, unlimited for a year.\nThey could use some remodeling, but overall it's cute and small kids love it. Watch out on those slides though they are old school metal slides and they go fast.

Minimal lines, plenty of shops and food options open, beautiful weather, I mean what more could you ask for?\nI appreciate that they have plenty of rides for the younger crew 5 and under.\n\nAdmission prices for a wristband were $10 cheaper / per person when you purchased tickets online. You have to order them at least a day before. So I'd definitely recommend going that route.",

It is operated very well, including maintenance, security, staff training, variety of rides and activities and food offerings. It offers discount evenings, passes and group purchase options which can help reduce the cost of a visit. While not cheap, it offers so much more than a visiting carnival. The location is beautiful and on an iconic beach. I am very impressed by the training that seems to go into staffing, the uniforms and visible security. I highly recommend visiting this coastal gem.",

I think the back of the park where all the animal exhibits are is very nice with lots of trees and a beautiful view of the lake. The exhibits themselves are good! Nothing mind blowing but it is nice to see. Then you get to the front of the park, where all the major coasters are and it is just ugly, especially the DC universe area. The ugliness is accentuated by the blacktop pathways which do go all over the park, but it is most noticeable here. It has zero landscaping with little theming. The operations at this park are very bad too. They run 1 train on everything, and it takes 5 minutes to dispatch a train! Do something about it six flags! If you are going on a busy day, I very highly recommend flash pass. There is no way you will be able to ride everything in one busy day here. The park's coaster collection is pretty good though! My favorite coaster by far is Joker. Also Medusa, Superman, and Batman are good supporting coasters, just avoid Kong. I like this park for the coasters and the zoo in the back. I do recommend a visit here, it can be a verry fun park! Just go into it knowing these things.",

Even though they only have five rides besides the train but for little kids it's a magical place. We as adults definitely enjoyed the train ride which was probably the best part of the whole place. Love that they have little towns and houses and lakes made so you can get an idea of how it feels to be on a real train. Also you have to go there and buy tickets. you cannot buy them online. Train tickets are separate from the ride tickets and they want coupon tickets which you have to purchase from the counter",

Bathrooms were great for families and the food was better than expected (see photo of the menu and prices).

Dance performances are scheduled throughout the day, with showtimes at 12:00 PM, 1:30 PM, 3:00 PM, and 4:30 PM. The park offers various attractions, including an arcade, petting zoo, thrilling roller coasters, and a drop zone. It is a relatively small park that can be experienced within approximately three hours, depending on queue lengths. It is worth noting that some rides were closed for maintenance during our visit, which was disappointing. Parking is complimentary, which is an advantage over other nearby theme parks. The admission fee has increased from a reasonable price to $29.95 per person. It is hoped that future price increases will be avoided to maintain the value proposition of the park.",

There's only one diaper changing station in the whole park so there can be a line if there are several babies needing to be changed at once.

Based on the hundreds of dollars spent just to get in, you\u2019d expect a better from Disney. California Adventure saves Disney on how many people want to go there.

A few rides were enjoyable, but overall, I felt the experience didn\u2019t justify getting a Lightning Lane pass\u2014it\u2019s not worth the extra money. If you start early, you can cover most of the rides without it. Honestly, the Disneyland theme park is better in comparison, so missing a few rides here isn\u2019t a big deal.

They have a ride outside where the restrooms are, they got bumper boats, Mini Golf.. You are going to have to come back to try everything. I mainly stayed in the arcade, and I have to say I am quite impressed by their selection of games as well as how affordable the prices are. The minimum for a game is 50 cents, but most games are $1 to $1.50. They have different choices to reload a card, and I\u2019m happy to say that it doesn\u2019t cost you anything for a new card. I think the best deal they have it the $35 package, which gives you $50 worth. Easily able to be there over 2 hours, and was able to obtain over 700 tickets.\n\nI would seriously come here more often if I lived closer. If we are in the area again sometime, will definitely stop by, and try out their other fun activities. Until next time!",

The employees are somewhat nice, could be nicer if they said please, thank you and you\u2019re welcome when talking / ordering people around. Also the snack bar lady Daisy was pretty rude, she doesn\u2019t know how to say you\u2019re welcome after two people clearly and loudly said thank you TWICE. She has no smile when serving customers but when her male coworkers came in to order lunch after us she\u2019s all smiles and nice lol which made us feel she had a problem with us. However, the older lady working at the snack bar is the best, she\u2019s so nice and well mannered, great customer service on her part. She\u2019s 5 stars.

                "text": "Last weekend, we had an absolute blast meeting up with friends and family for a night of mini golf! As soon as we approached the entrance, we were greeted by the sight of a massive castle adorned with vibrant neon lights. It set the perfect mood for an evening filled with fun and laughter. The air was electric with the sounds of arcade games all around us, including some of the beloved classics that sparked happy nostalgia for many in our group.\n\nDespite the bustling atmosphere, we made our way to the back to grab our golf clubs. There was a sense of excitement in the air as we prepared for our adventure on the course. We opted for the full 18 holes since we had a large crew, and honestly, I can\u2019t think of a better way to bond and challenge each other than some friendly competition.\n\nAs we stepped onto the course, I noticed it was in great shape! Some reviews had mentioned issues, but we found everything to be tidy and well-maintained, aside from a few stray leaves,  which was perfectly understandable given the season. Each hole presented unique obstacles and creative designs that kept us on our toes and added a fun twist to the game. From tricky slopes to whimsical decorations, every play was a new adventure and a chance for a laugh.\n\nThe excitement was palpable as we all took turns, cheering each other on and playfully teasing those who missed easy putts! At one point, we even had a spontaneous dance-off between holes. I\u2019m pretty sure the other players must have thought we were a bit wild, but who could blame us? The energy was infectious!\n\nOverall, it was an evening filled with joy, laughter, and maybe a few friendly rivalries. As the final scores were tallied, we were already making plans to come back for another round. If you\u2019re looking for an entertaining night out with friends or family, this mini golf spot is a winner. We had such a fantastic time, and I can\u2019t wait for our next adventure there!",

And getting help from anyone takes a long time , and honestly the whole ring door bell thing is really ghetto. Your staff is amazing doing the best they can, there is not enough of them. I spent a lot of money, and me and my kids waited for every single attraction over 15 min , and we were the only ones in line. When we came in we asked about the arcade add on but she did not know how to do it. Then my kid lost his golf ball wanted a certain color, and couldn\u2019t get it. So I could have spent more money but. I did not. And I won\u2019t be coming back. It was cool when I was a kid, I am now 36 and you guys need to update it for this generation of kids , and get more staff. I wish I could have my money back!",

We love this park and all the rides. Never had an issues using fast lane but I do see regular lines always having 30+ minute wait during the afternoon/evening. Highly recommend coming early and knocking out the big rides or even getting fast pass. All day dining is a great plan if you like to eat lol. We share on dining pass as she likes most of the sides and I eat the entree and we time every hour and a half to eat again to get out money's worth. Great place for people starting their Rollercoaster journey as they have family friendly rides to thrill rides!",

The park itself was clean, and the customer service was excellent especially in the overcrowded BBQ dining area. It didn't take longer than about 30 minutes to get on each ride w/o the ride and reserve pass. We were hoping that the driving school reopened but we were informed that it would be back this summer. The driver/pilot license is such a cute idea, our son was really excited to be a Legoland certified pilot. We unfortunately ended up losing our son's sweatshirt we purchased that day as we were leaving the park, and that was a bummer once we arrived home. Nevertheless, we contacted the park and are hoping that they either find or replace it. Overall, a great experience, the miniland, and the underwater explorer were some of our biggest highlights. We can't wait to return again.",

Arriving early at 10:15 AM, we had a great time exploring the park, which is perfect for kids aged 4 to 12. The rides were fun, and the app was useful for tracking wait times. With around 15 rides, one day is enough if planned well, but two days are better for experiencing everything. We managed about half the rides in a day.\n\nBringing your own snacks and drinks is allowed, and purchasing a parking ticket in advance saves time. Some rides can get you wet, so extra clothes are recommended. Restrooms were clean, and overall, it was a well-organized and enjoyable experience.",

                "text": "If I could give a negative I would. My son had a banquet there I have 2 sons the banquet was for my 12 year old (old enough to rome a little more freely then my other) I stuck to my 4 year old. He LOVED the junior go carts so we literally back to back for a good hour no line no older kids bullying the little ones. Took a good break came back more kids all ranges of ages (some should not have been able to get on at all period just saying) so there's a line of about 20 kids my son is probably around the 10th, mind you he's going alone no friends not in a group nothing. The associate that was working the carts is a dwarf one of the kids at the front of the line(in a bigger group of kids no chaperone all ages)called him a midget. I didn't hear it I can't tell you the context situation nothing. All I know is my son didn't say it and he's been in line for about 20 minutes because kids keep pushing him back cutting in line. The associate gets mad yells at the kids all of them and some random guest a nobody gets in front on the entire group and addresses ALL parents and kids calling us all disgusting we are a disgrace we shouldn't be parents so on and so on. I look at him and said don't address my son and don't speak on me and mine without knowing who the hell I am. He insisted on being a \"hero\" yelling at a bunch of kids and women. Okay so myself and another mother left the kids with siblings and confronted the man about how he is wrong. He owes us an apology and he needs to learn to handle situations better if he's going to try and save the day you figure out who said it you fine the parent and you address it period. So it escalated got ghetto because the husbands and bfs coaches weren't going to let this man talk anyway to our kids and women and think he's off Scott free. He was singing a whole different tune now. Then I went back to my youngest STILL IN LINE! the associate is skipping and taking whoever is basically being pushy and handing him the card first. Mind you my son's a shy 4 year old alone he's just excited to \"drive\" so of course he's getting skipped I can't even trust him to not lose his card so the adult has it. That's crazy my son's now been in line about 35 40 minutes a manager comes out of the carts are after speaking with the associate about what happened and I politely said excuse my son's been in line for over 30 minutes because he's not going in order of the line that's ridiculous and unfair my son didn't do anything to deserve that type of behavior her response was I trust his judgement and what is doing and I'll have his back. Oh great management skills, so trust that everything that went down was justified and trust me your lucky. Is there any type of management skills customer service skill anyone that has some type of common sense to de-escalate the situation so you can make everyone happy. Clearly I'll never come back I'll never suggest it and honestly I don't for see this place ever becoming a must see attraction. Horrible stay away from this place.",

It was my first time to SeaWorld, and my family hadn't been for years, and that was the one in Florida, so this felt completely brand new, and I was not disappointed. The service was quick, the lines never felt slow, and the shows were incredible, especially the orca show. I mean, a flipping killer whale was doing flips and jumping in and out of the water. I'm also a sucker for turtles, and do that immediately boosted it for me. The roller coasters were incredible, with a short wait time and a thrilling experience.\nThe food does need some work. Granted, it's theme park food, so it's not the best, but other than that, the day was thrilling and a magical experience. Plus, the sea lion show was fun to watch. They made it like a little story, and that appealed to me.",

Should be worth it if you have little ones and from around here. If you only have a single day ticket I heard they charge $30+ for parking.\n- Download the app before going so you can see the park schedule and directions!\n- Park is not too busy and almost no wait time for all the rides and picture taking with the characters.\n- I have a 2 year old and was able to enjoy 4 different rides!\n- The atmosphere is amazing, it's very open and a perfect place to spend the day with your little one.\n- I heard a lot of negative comments about this place and was hesitant to go at first, but after our visit, we actually loved it.\n- Park says outside food and beverage are not allowed, but they let us in with a lot different toddler food/snacks.\n- I personally think the photos from them are not that good lol. It doesn't look professional just a normal photo. I purchased a printed one with elmo for $25.\n- Parade starts at 3:30, nothing too fancy but i keep reminding myself it's not for us, its for the kids \ud83d\ude02\n- Will go back for sure!

The rides, water attractions, and character interactions create a magical experience that brings Sesame Street to life. The park is well-maintained, and the staff in most areas are friendly and accommodating.\n\nHowever, the food service, particularly at Monster Snack, needs significant improvement. The wait times for food are excessively long, which can be frustrating, especially with hungry children. Additionally, I noticed employees eating chicken tenders while taking orders, which is highly unprofessional. Food handlers should maintain proper hygiene, including wearing gloves, especially when serving meals to kids.\n\nOverall, while Sesame Place excels in entertainment and family fun, the food service experience detracts from the visit. Improving efficiency, enforcing stricter hygiene standards, and ensuring professionalism among staff would greatly enhance the park\u2019s overall quality.",

However Hollywood gives good areas for what they do have. I didn\u2019t like that majority of the rides were simulated, got very light headed after one. The Jurassic Park ride was fun, that was the best ride experience to me. They were building a physical ride there I\u2019m not sure of what it will be. The Harry Potter experience was good. I will say buying the ticket for the early bird super Mario experience made it worth it. I would say that the time of season matters. California kids are not on spring break during March so no bad wait in lines. Basically just tourists there. The decorations were good and we enjoyed it. There is a shopping center on the outside that\u2019s really cool. We finished the park really quick and went there. Oh they do serve the beer butter. The staff was nice. Parking was easy.",

After paying an absurd price for a family of 5 to play mini golf at $125 for an 18 hole course, the conditions could not have been worse.

Also, for younger kids buy the three pack pass. By the time you stand in lines and walk around its the perfect amount of activity for the day. We were there about 6.5 hours and had a blast.

We walked in for my nieces 10th birthday party last night, only to be jumping for 10 minutes before a disgusting and vile fight broke out between a ton of adults who also involved their children in the fight. This fight went on for over 15 minutes before security, any of the employees, or police stepped in! Fighting and cussing and being disgusting right in the front lobby in front of all of the staff who were blatantly ignoring them and subjecting every child there to this trauma. When my family member asked for a refund for the $500 birthday party she just paid for, the staff refused and only agreed to partially refund her her money. They made her pay for jump socks and 4 pizzas that we weren\u2019t even able to utilize and still kept over $200 of her money! Everyone who checked in at 5pm were forcibly removed from the premises, but if you had reservations at 7pm or later, you were allowed to come back and jump. My niece\u2019s entire birthday party ruined for some ghetto disgusting fighting. Even more disgusting that all the staff and security just stood there watching a huge fist fight break out in their lobby in front of all these children!

My guests had to go back upfront to get a different size because they gave them all small. They only provide one juice or one water per jumper. So if parents want something to drink they charge you $2.00 for a water and because we went on a weekend they charged $2.50. Their website says that the host will help with set up, service and clean up. They did not do any of that. While we were doing cake a host come in the room and took the utensil/plate/napkin hold her. I advised that we were not done and they responded with \u201cI\u2019m taking it to refill it\u201d. It was returned after we got done. While picking up the room a staff member come in and asked who to give the bill to.

Food selection is not very good but decent I guess. I would say the fair has better overall options though. When we arrived at noon it was bad. As the day went on it seemed to get a little more lively. I read the past reviews and the most disappointing thing is that it seems the \u201cowner\u201d just copy and pastes his reply to any and all negative reviews saying he would pass it on to the management. Bro you are the owner, why don\u2019t you do something about it. It is kind of sad because I feel like it has true potential with know one really wanting to improve it. The wooden roller coaster really needs to be inspected! You can see it move and shake more than it should. There are nuts, bolts, and washers everywhere! Try caring about your park just a little more. Cleaning and upkeep would make a world of difference. Overall not terrible but not great.",

You will save a lot of money on parking on top of being able to bring friends, plus you get a discount on nearly everything in the park. Fright Fest and Luminova were a lot of fun. It's cool to be able to see the park transform. The food and drinks are really expensive and not the best. The pizza place near the entrance is usually less busy and a little quieter than the main food court. I would recommend bringing your own water bottle to refill. There's a water fountain outside the bathrooms by the main entrance. If you have never been and are on the fence, I think it is a memorable experience and a good way to spend time with family and friends.",

The gondola ride up the mountain alone is worth the price of admission, offering incredible views before you even reach the amusement park at the top.\n\nThe park features four awesome rides, and I had the chance to try two of them. The alpine coaster was a huge hit\u2014both my son and I loved it. The slingshot ride, which launches you right off the edge of the mountain, is perfect for thrill seekers looking for an adrenaline rush.\n\nOne of the highlights of the visit was the cave tours. The standard cave tour is included in the $56 full-day ticket and lasts about an hour, with a knowledgeable guide sharing fascinating details about the caves and their preservation. We also opted for the blacklight cave tour for an additional $20, and it was totally worth it\u2014such a fun and unique experience!\n\nPlan to spend around 5 to 6 hours here for a full experience. The park is open from 10 AM to 6 PM, so there\u2019s plenty of time to explore. The gift shop on the mountain is a nice stop, offering fun souvenirs and even free fudge samples. There\u2019s also a cafeteria and a bar behind the gift shop, making it a great spot to relax.\n\nI visited with my wife, a friend, and my seven-year-old son, and we all had an amazing time. Glenwood Caverns is definitely worth a visit for families and thrill seekers alike!",

I read reviews so I had low expectations, but in reality Lakeside far exceeded those. It's an amusement park experience from yesteryear. My kids absolutely loved Kiddieland, as they have about a dozen rides for young children. We got a whole pizza for dinner which was actually very tasty, but order it with light cheese. Many rides were broken, some in pieces, yet it was a fascinating trip to a different time of amusement parks. I'll bring my kids back for sure.",

The Santa they have working with his helpers were very accommodating and friendly. The train,carousel and another ride weren\u2019t working when we were there this past weekend which was a bummer.

It\u2019s $30 for parking which I\u2019m not sure why. I guess you can\u2019t escape paying extra when you go anywhere. Cashless so make sure you have a credit or debit card for parking.\n\nThere are 4 haunted houses to go in. One was boring and not scary. The other three were fun. I don\u2019t scare easily but they definitely put effort into it. Overall it was a lot of fun. It is the oldest amusement park in the US. Lots of fun rides, games and concession stands.

                "text": "This review is for the Holiday Lights event at Lake Compounce.\n\nThis is the oldest operating amusement park in the U.S. and it opened in 1846. It's 365 acres and located in Bristol and Southington, CT. The body of water located in the park is the Lake Compounce; there is a beach at the lake and a water park. The name of the lake came from a native American who signed a deed over to the settlers; Chief John Compound, who was from the Mattatuck-Tunxis tribe.\n\nThere are 44 attractions, 5 rollercoasters, and 13 water rides. Wildcat is the 14th oldest wooden rollercoaster in the world. They also have a newer award winning wooden rollercoaster called Boulder Dash; this has been named the #1 wooden rollercoaster in the world for 5 years. The historic Lake Compounce Carousel was built around 1890 and moved to the park in 1911.\n\nIn December, they host the Holiday Lights event which runs through December 31. It's a fun event for children and adults. They deck the park with lights and have the tallest Christmas tree in CT, which is 100 ft tall. There were plenty of rides, games, and activities. Some activities include letters to Santa, DIY snow globe, and personalized ornaments.\n\nThere's an opportunity to visit Santa, holiday characters, and storytime. There are some dining options onsite such as Johnny Rockets, a food truck, and dining hall. The prices were high which is typical for amusement parks. I've read that people bring their own food/drinks and would go eat it in the car and go back into the park after.\n\nWe went on a Saturday evening which was pretty busy but not too overwhelming. There was a parking booth, large parking lot, and attendants showing people where to park. Upon entering the park, you can't miss that beautiful large Christmas tree. The restrooms were plentiful and clean. There are ticket booths and the lines moved pretty quickly. The rides were plentiful, cute, and fun for the kids. It was very cold and in the teens; there were some fire pits if you want to warm up. The lines for the rides were short and quick; the longest was the train ride.\n\nWe were there for 3.5 hours and left right before it closed. We didn't get to ride all the rides but felt like we got our money's worth. Overall, my family and especially my child enjoyed the the park. This is definitely going to be a family tradition going forward. Also, I can't wait to check it out in the summer and will provide another update.",

Amusement park rides are very old but cute. Great for young kids.\n\nBoardwalk was nice and new. Loved the splash pad and playground for kids. Pool was closed.  Beach was beautiful and had a variety of different sea shells. Unfortunately, there was quite a lot of garbage (dirty tissue, cigarette butt, food wrappers) on the sand from people who did not use the garbage cans. Alewife Cove nature trail was nice and the water was shallow. It was great for wading in and seeing cute little crabs and hermit crabs in the water.",

                "text": "Yes, I'm giving it 5 stars. Reality says it shouldn't- as only a pint sized 6 flags, the food is overpriced, the bathrooms are not cleaned enough. But for younger kids this old fashioned and quaint park did amuse my family for half a day. They have some exciting tubing slides and wonderfully creative splash tower including many filled buckets to douse persons below and working water cannons, etc. I forget the name of the knockout roller coaster because for good reason no cell phones are allowed on the ride and I forgot to take a picture) that defies gravity; the rickety metal track clanged so hard I thought we'd be the ones that finally broke off the guard threatening our lives(but is too short a ride). There is also the \"Frantic\" which spins and turns you upside down. We are next to one of the food establishments and sat on some of the many stools with a majestic serene view of the lake. For an extra charge they allow paddle boats of two to four passengers. Outside food is permitted and Quassy serves alcohol. Definitely parents can have fun here. I think the place is right-sized and doesn't feel missing per se compared to the sprawling Lake Compounce. For the youngest patrons, they will find themselves occupied in awe. It is just the older teenagers that might find the place wanting for more. So highly recommended for parents and their children between 36 inches and 13 years old. PS- I think they also had a magic show but we missed it. Also, the picture I have of the roller coaster is called \"Little Dipper\" and is NOT the hair raising one I described above.",

                "text": "Not a bad place to visit especially since it\u2019s in Long Island. Not a lot of ethnic diversity either to be honest but still pretty friendly. This place is mainly for kids aged 4-10 years. Lots of kiddie rides and height restrictions like 44-48 inches in order to ride alone or at least with an adult 18+ years of age. Lots of classic carnival games to play like ring toss, basketball shot, water pistol shooter etc with tons of prizes for choose from winning which it should since it is an amusement park. Food is also ok but pricing could use a little adjusting. Plenty of car parking around and they even have special events and conditions for birthday rentals. Bumper cars were kind of boring and the arcades could use a lot more variety in games. Overall I did like the park but gave it 3 star because it reminded me of a much less mundane version of 6 flags. The wait times were the best part as I managed to get through the whole park in 2 hours. Summer time maybe much busier so I can\u2019t really say for certain but this place does have its moments. Some of the rides was actually inspired by 6 flags like the fireball or tornado. The day pass was $40 and came with a silver wristband which looked pretty nice. Bunch of places to take pictures and make memories.",

Some people who had not looked at the website and were also there when we were seemed more disgruntled, but the park fully discloses this before you pay. We had some discounted tickets, and for a few hours of good fun with very little wait, it was very much worth it. Much of the outside part of the park is run down, including the mini golf, but I overheard discussions about repairs and updates that are being made, and there were workers in the water park getting it ready while we were there. I really want to compliment the staff. When I had a question about the location of an attraction, I had no trouble finding someone.

The swings were awesome and the lady working them was so kind. We loved the go karts, me and my 8 year old aimed for all the coins to make it more fun for her. The indoor scrambler was our favorite part. It was AWESOME. The music, the strobe lights, the fog and the workers made it so much fun. The painting on the walls was so cool.

I had been planning a surprise Bachelorette party for my sister for a few months and began collaborating with Scott in June of 2021. Upon arrival, he let us decorate my sister's kart, use the event center room and ordered us some pizza, and offered us to use the mini golf course! His staff was an awesome group and made sure to take pictures/videos of us to add to our memory book. The gas-powered go karts are FAST and fun- if you like adrenaline you will LOVE his place! You have options as there are 2 courses to race on, an airsoft field, a gift shop, mini golf, the event center room with some awesome arcade games inside! We will for sure be back with our old friends AND new friends. Spread the word, slay the course, and eat my dust bunny!",

                "text": "Enchanted Forest Water Safari is such a massive park. I will be honest I had no idea that this park was this large when I went there for the first time. They have some really great slides that are a lot of fun.\nI recommend going on the Curse of the Silverback ride. I probably waited a half hour for this ride in the hot sun but it was worth it. They have a family deal for tickets if you purchase ahead online that offers a pizza, ice cream cones and large refillable soda/water cups for all family members.\n\nThe park itself is massive so it is important to have a system if you are going with a lot of kids to make sure they are all supervised. They have a story time land for smaller kids with older still reenactments of classic stories from the Black Forest.\n\nThey also have a petting zoo which is pretty cool as well. The slides and the water park are spread out pretty much everywhere you go so you can\u2019t miss it.\n\nOn top of all of this, they have a bunch of rides like helicopters, bumper cars, boats, Ferris wheels, and so much more. They also have a live performers at this large amphitheater outside as well, and a train that runs through the park nonstop as well.\n\nThere are beach cabanas for rent and the next time I go back I would definitely get one of those. Having shade during the hot months is something that is going to make you feel so much better because you will be able to enjoy your day more.\n\nAll in all, this is a large entity to take on as just one family but it can a lot of fun. There will never be a shortage of anything to do which is nice as well. It\u2019s amazing that this park has held up so well over the years, the owners really do a nice job taking care of everything.",

Upon my arrival, the foremost wonder that captured my attention was none other than the illustrious Arieforce One, a masterful creation by the renowned artisans at Rocky Mountain Construction. From the very moment of ascent to the finality of the break run, I found myself enraptured by its splendid craftsmanship. Though brief in duration, this marvel delivers an unparalleled thrill that leaves one utterly astonished.\n\nThe remaining attractions within this delightful park are equally worthy of admiration, particularly the commendable Go Kars. These conveyances afford a most splendid experience, indeed! I must implore you not to underestimate the modesty of this establishment, for it harbors treasures that await discovery by the discerning visitor.\n\nI beseech you, noble friends, do not hesitate to include this charming venue in your plans. A visit here is an opportunity not to be regretted; you shall find it to be every bit as magnificent as my words profess!",

Tonight I showed up with my brother, sister, and brother's girlfriend in costumes. On the way in there was not one complaint from staff or customers. Some people even asked to take photos. A nice gentlemen even gave us free tickets. After scanning our tickets, a bitter employee got snappy with my brother and I and she told me to take his and my props back to my truck. I didn't hesitate to comply cause I knew people like her were just gonna try to punish you more if you tried to argue, so I walked for a few minutes, put them up, then came back. Then another one of Lake Winnie's finest told me I can't wear a mask, an essential part of this costume I worked hard on. He told me that nobody over 12 could wear masks for \"security reasons\". What a joke. If you enjoy Halloween and want some public Halloween fun outside of just trick or treating, go somewhere other than Lake Winnie \ud83d\udc4e",

There are plenty of places to rest in the shade and places to buy a drink. Parking is plentiful. I appreciated the senior rate of $32.95 as it was a $10 discount. If you are looking for a place to take the kids with a water feature and rides close to home, this is a nice option.",

                "text": "I had a lot of fun at Six Flags Over Georgia on Saturday (3/22), and my visit was honestly a mixed bag.\n\nFirstly, the ride operations definitely need improvement. Some of the major coasters like Batman The Ride, Georgia Scorcher, and Twisted Cyclone, were running only one train very early in the day, leading to significantly long wait times. The Flash Pass queue management had left much to be desired. Even with the discount, the lines were STILL excessively long and the experience for many people wasn't as efficient as it should be, which CAN diminish the time-saving benefit.\nAdditionally, there were noticeable ride delays and breakdowns that could have been addressed much more efficiently, especially when you consider the frustration from the number of people waiting in line (regardless of whether or not they had a Flash Pass). I understand these things happen, but ride management would significantly benefit from a more diligent & proactive approach and better communication when handling these disruptions. Therefore, these solutions along with clearer updates would greatly improve the overall guest experience.\n\nOn the positive side, the weather was absolutely PERFECT and ideal for enjoying the rides - from the thrilling ones to the more family-friendly ones. It was fantastic to have such a great day for coaster riding, making it a comfortable day for everyone. The park itself was also noticeably clean, and the staff maintained a high level of cleanliness and professionalism (which is commendable). A huge shoutout to Guest Relations, who were incredibly kind, sincere, and attentive, and they listened to my concerns. The atmosphere was incredibly electric and exciting, especially since it was my birthday weekend!\n\nOVERALL, this park has a lot of great potential and I'm glad that they're stepping it up. I had an amazing and memorable time due to the excellent weather, exciting atmosphere, clean park and friendly staff! I sincerely hope that Six Flags Over Georgia can address the ride operation and efficiency concerns that I've noticed AND maintain the positive atmosphere, high level of cleanliness and high level of customer service throughout the entire season.",

We enjoyed the VIP room. Short one star because some of the employees were extremely rude. My kids left the line at Catwoman after waiting there for 45min because they couldn't stand how the employees were yelling at and treating the people getting on and off the ride. They couldn't stand to watch it over and over again as people try to get on and off. Sad that 2 people can ruin it for everyone. They also don't have all the drink refill stations open yet, probably because it's the start of the season. Be aware of you by the cup, you may be waiting in a food line to refill. Quick, easy parking and entry into the park. Over all a clean park.",

                "text": "Having engaged in a lengthy pursuit of leisure at the esteemed establishment known as Six Flags Over Georgia, I find myself compelled to share the particulars of my recent expedition. This occasion, while marked by some measure of expectation, ultimately proved to be rather lackluster, indeed, akin to a rather ordinary affair.\n\nAlas, the operations of the park were nothing short of disconcerting. It appears that the management may benefit from a more diligent approach to the orchestration of their attractions, for the overall experience left much to be desired. Perhaps it is my penchant for the extraordinary that renders this so grievous to my sensibilities. The anticipation that accompanied my visit was soon eclipsed by the disarray encountered amidst the attractions.\n\nThat said, one must commend the cleanliness of the park\u2014it was maintained with a vigilance that is often hard to find in such establishments. The throngs of visitors, indicative of the park\u2019s popularity, did create a vibrant atmosphere, yet one cannot help but feel that such busyness further compounded the operational challenges at hand.\n\nAmong the various amusements, the introduction of the Georgia Goldrusher stands as a notable highlight of this expedition. This new addition possesses a certain charm and is splendid in its execution, although I find myself wishing that they might consider omitting the spinning component; the thrill of such contrivance is rather lost upon me.\n\nIn summation, while I would earnestly encourage those who find themselves in the vicinity to pay a visit to this park, I opine that it does not warrant an extensive journey. My final judgment, after careful consideration of all factors\u2014both the delightful and the disappointing\u2014leads me to a rather modest appraisal of 6 out of 10. It is a harmonious blend of merriment and mediocrity, deserving of both patronage and critique in equal measure.",

It was not busy compared to our summer visit! We hardly had to wait in line for any of the rides, which was absolutely excellent for my teen who gets very anxious waiting in line for rides.\n\nIt did start drizzling some later in the evening, but everything stayed open and running until the rain got a little heavier. Then some rides had to close. However because we did not have to wait in line earlier, we got to ride everything that we had wanted to ride! It was a really fun afternoon.\n\nWe loved all of the holiday lights and decorations. They had a s'mores roasting station, some places serving hot cocoa, and even a North Pole area where you could play in fake snow and do some crafts if you wanted to.",

Season tickets are affordable and there is safety officers/police officers throughout.  The staff followed the policies and it felt very much like they all were trained well.  They were not afraid to tell someone no but were not mean about it, very professional from what I had saw in the past. Mostly everything I saw was clean besides a few spills that had just happened.  Definitely recommended and will be back.\n\nWish the app had wait times like Disneys/Dollywood, but wait times were posted throughout the park.  The wait times were never that long.

I arrived at 6 pm and still rode everything I wanted to, twice, within 2 hours.\n\nNow, I only did the tube slides, the lazy river, and the wave pool, but the kids areas looked nice, especially the Idaho-themed splash tower. I don't get the \"class 5 canyon\" lazy river with waves. They offer a kick-board to lean on but you can't really ride the waves that way and any adult will immediately sink one (and they don't let you stack them up.) It would be much more enjoyable with tubes. Otherwise, everything looks great.",

This is a smaller park area wise than other water parks, which is good so you need not have to walk a lot from one attraction to another. I also liked their spectator option so you can pay only half of the fee if you are not going into the water, but just going for taking care of kids. They also have a lot of sitting areas under shade. I went on a Monday so its not too crowded.",

We\u2019ve gotten a cabana both times we\u2019ve gone and it\u2019s so nice to have a shady spot with comfy chairs and couches plus a table, a locker for your valuables and a staff member assigned to helping you. We always had fresh water and never waited in line for food. Love the expansion, our cabana was right along the brand new lazy river. Staff is friendly, helpful and they work hard! Younger generation of lifeguards and wait staff and all were BUSY! I never saw a single one of them standing around doing nothing. They search your bags for food (annoying, but it\u2019s the rules) and the pavement is hard to walk on for hours in bare feet\u2026 but I am old. \ud83d\ude06 It\u2019s pricey, even without a cabana, so we we only go once a year and stay open to close. Overall we feel VERY fortunate to have a wonderful waterpark nearby!",

Once you get through the main gate you can go to the amusement park side or the water park side. The first time ever visiting it was packed. We started off at the water park right at opening time. We claimed some seats to set our stuff and wandered around. We spent a lot of time in lines for water attractions. If you don\u2019t like to wait in line you can go to the wave pool, ride a tube around the lazy river, or go to a toddler area to watch your little one run around. After playing at the water park we went to the amusement park side. On this side there\u2019s many rollercoasters and also some small rides for toddlers. The next day we had a better understanding of it all. My son and I went and dropped off our towels and headed towards the most popular attractions right off the bat! Our second day it was cold and rainy. We froze, but the bright side of it all was there wasn\u2019t any lines! We went down all the rides several times. We got our moneys worth on our final day! Next time maybe I\u2019ll wear a wet suit and choose a rainy day again! No lines!",

But I\u2019m still going to point it out because it was our one & only experience of this place so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the norm or not.\n\nThis is a fun place and has the potential for a fantastic day with friends/family.\n\nUnfortunately, we were limited on what could be experienced because over half of the rides were shut down and over half of the games didn\u2019t work due to a \u201cglitch in the system\u201d at customer service. We chose this place to come from out of town to meet friends who also traveled from out of town so we were bummed & felt our time was kind of wasted, esp for being the middle of a weekend day. We were unable to do go-karts or bumper cars because they were shut down. The bar was closed for the day and we were told we were limited on what we could get from the food/drink area. Our kids played games but when we went to redeem our tickets, the system said we didn\u2019t have any. Again, very sad kiddos for a fun day at the arcade. We all had a blast during laser tag but we were told we had to wait 30min before we could play? It made no sense since there were only a handful of people in the whole place while we were there and no one went in or out of the laser complex while we waited. Overall, we\u2019d try it again but for what you pay, I expect everything to be up & running correctly.",

                "text": "Pretty park. Despite the huge crowds for their haunted event,they worked hard to keep the park clean and did a good job for the most part. They're adding another roller coaster so this meant that there's an entire area we cannot through which unfortunately holds another coaster. But we were able to ride all the others this past Saturday. We had the all day dining plan which meant we got to sample a good bit of food here. Sadly,they closed their large indoor seating restaurant over an hour and a half early ,and several others as well. That's not ok especially since there's no posted times that they close on the restaurants. This park have very little markings as to where you find things. We observed many spots where they could've placed the newer screens that have maps on them,or sign posts with arrows pointing which direction you'd find rides,restaurants, shops or shows. That's truly frustrating to newcomers.  There's not 1 single automatic door in this park. So if handicapped people do not have a person with them they have to struggle to open doors,and that's really frustrating and embarrassing. All of the exits om each roller coaster is WAY too long,and all but the last few newer ones,they're way too narrow. This park seriously needs to do a LOT of work to be more handicap accessible. Their 1 coaster ,the whizzer,doesn't even have a ramp or loft of any kind for accessibility! But I'll say this,the ride operations here were leagues above the 6 other six flags parks We've visited. Especially at raging bull and Viper. WONDERFUL  crews there this past Saturday November 2. Six flags' policy of charging extra for their haunted attractions is also complete nonsense.  It isn't right.\nI'm hoping with the recent merger with cedar fair that the six flags parks can be improved to a better over all park experience exper. This one was the best out of all 7 six flags we've visited for sure.",

We purchased tickets online for Saturday and ended up buying additional tickets at the park for Sunday.\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our visit, which really enhanced the experience. However, because the park is closed during the week in August, Saturday was extremely busy. We arrived about 30 minutes after the park opened, and the parking lot was already full\u2014a mistake on our part. Due to the long lines, we only had time to ride four water attractions that day.\n\nSunday was a different story. We arrived 30 minutes before the park opened and were among the first in line to enter. This made a huge difference! We were able to ride The Voyage twice, The Thunderbird three times, and then we changed into our swimwear to enjoy the water rides. The park has lockers available, which made storing our belongings convenient.\n\nThe variety of things to do is truly endless. From the rides to the gift shops and dining options, there\u2019s something for everyone. Although we didn\u2019t eat inside the park, it was great that we could pack a cooler and return to our vehicle for meals, as re-entry is allowed. Another standout feature is the unlimited free soft drinks, including water, which adds great value to the visit.\n\nIt was an amazing experience for the whole family.

My family and I had a blast wandering through lands dedicated to Christmas, Halloween, 4th of July, and Thanksgiving, each one bursting with festive spirit, holiday music, and delightful themed rides.\n\nStarting in Christmas Land, we were greeted by the familiar jingle of holiday tunes and towering, twinkling trees that made us feel like it was December\u2014even in the heat of July! Halloween Land was spooky fun, with eerie decorations and thrilling rides that got our adrenaline pumping. When we reached the patriotic vibes of the 4th of July section, we couldn\u2019t resist waving imaginary sparklers and enjoying a few \u201cred, white, and blue\u201d treats. Thanksgiving Land, of course, served up classic autumnal decor and a few delicious pumpkin-flavored treats.\n\nNow, let's talk food. While not quite what you'd expect from a holiday feast, it was enough to keep us fueled as we ran from ride to ride. But no complaints here\u2014we were way too busy exploring each land's attractions to notice!\n\nThe star of our day was the Cheetah Chase in the water park! It\u2019s honestly the most exhilarating water ride I\u2019ve ever been on, with twists and turns that had us laughing, screaming, and bonding all at once. The kids and I couldn't get enough, racing down the slides with pure joy.\n\nTo top it off, the Christmas-themed stores just outside the park kept the holiday magic going a bit longer. We wandered through aisles of ornaments and festive knick-knacks, feeling the spirit of the season long after we left the gates. Holiday World delivered a unique, fun-filled day that left us tired, happy, and just a little bit festive all over",

Would I recommend traveling over 3 hours for it? No. But I love this place. My kids ride until they can't ride anymore. No 3 hour waits. Lots of rides for shorter children as well. It's safe. Parking is easy if your legs work well. We tailgate. We snack inside. We close it down sometimes. We open it up sometimes. We bring friends. Don't plan on getting a decent cup of coffee. Bar across the street makes Amazing pizza. Plan on tailgating for lunch in the huge grassy parking area and get a relaxing break and hit it again. Every ride will not be open at all times. It's a rural area and I think employees rotate. Just go with the flow and enjoy.",

It's not a show piece and is a bit rundown. The food options aren't great, it's all the standard fair food. They need something to help elevate that.\n\nThe rides are good and what bring the rating so high. Is relatively inexpensive for a family to spend all day and night here.

We chose this place to come from out of town to meet friends who also traveled from out of town so we were bummed & felt our time was kind of wasted, esp for being the middle of a weekend day. We were unable to do go-karts or bumper cars because they were shut down. The bar was closed for the day and we were told we were limited on what we could get from the food/drink area. Our kids played games but when we went to redeem our tickets, the system said we didn\u2019t have any. Again, very sad kiddos for a fun day at the arcade. We all had a blast during laser tag but we were told we had to wait 30min before we could play? It made no sense since there were only a handful of people in the whole place while we were there and no one went in or out of the laser complex while we waited.

                "text": "Not a bad place to visit especially since it\u2019s in Long Island. Not a lot of ethnic diversity either to be honest but still pretty friendly. This place is mainly for kids aged 4-10 years. Lots of kiddie rides and height restrictions like 44-48 inches in order to ride alone or at least with an adult 18+ years of age. Lots of classic carnival games to play like ring toss, basketball shot, water pistol shooter etc with tons of prizes for choose from winning which it should since it is an amusement park. Food is also ok but pricing could use a little adjusting. Plenty of car parking around and they even have special events and conditions for birthday rentals. Bumper cars were kind of boring and the arcades could use a lot more variety in games. Overall I did like the park but gave it 3 star because it reminded me of a much less mundane version of 6 flags. The wait times were the best part as I managed to get through the whole park in 2 hours. Summer time maybe much busier so I can\u2019t really say for certain but this place does have its moments. Some of the rides was actually inspired by 6 flags like the fireball or tornado. The day pass was $40 and came with a silver wristband which looked pretty nice. Bunch of places to take pictures and make memories.",

When we visited (on a Saturday in August), the park was uncrowded and there was virtually no wait for any of the attractions. The park is clean and well-landscaped. Food prices were reasonable.

Staff was friendly and welcoming, as well as meticulous about safety.\nThis park isn't as well known as its water park, so there were zero lines. Every ride was a walk on, which worked out really well for our multiple autistic kids.\nImmediately when you walk in the thought that went into this park is evident, the different themed worlds are unique while still being cohesive with the rest of the park.\nEverything is easily visible and I was able to let my older kid break off from the group occasionally to go ride rides the little ones couldn't.\nThe tamariki area is amazing for the little ones, my 2 year old was able to do all but 2 of the rides (with an adult)\nWe are already planning next summers trip back, it was well worth the 5 hour drive from Wisconsin!\nWe hope the theme park gets more business so they can stay open, it really is a fantastic park for all ages & abilities.",

There was plenty to do for the adults and older kids and also for the younger one (age 9 but plenty for littler ones too). It was fun and interactive with characters walking around and all the staff was great and friendly! Our favorites were the bumper cars and roller coasters. Also ate lunch (they have two indoor restaurant places) and food was good and quick to get! Lots of bathrooms and water fountains throughout the park as well. Everything was clean and the whole family had fun! We went on a Tuesday so hardly any lines but everything was open and ready for us to ride.",

But I\u2019m still going to point it out because it was our one & only experience of this place so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the norm or not.\n\nThis is a fun place and has the potential for a fantastic day with friends/family.\n\nUnfortunately, we were limited on what could be experienced because over half of the rides were shut down and over half of the games didn\u2019t work due to a \u201cglitch in the system\u201d at customer service. We chose this place to come from out of town to meet friends who also traveled from out of town so we were bummed & felt our time was kind of wasted, esp for being the middle of a weekend day. We were unable to do go-karts or bumper cars because they were shut down. The bar was closed for the day and we were told we were limited on what we could get from the food/drink area. Our kids played games but when we went to redeem our tickets, the system said we didn\u2019t have any. Again, very sad kiddos for a fun day at the arcade. We all had a blast during laser tag but we were told we had to wait 30min before we could play? It made no sense since there were only a handful of people in the whole place while we were there and no one went in or out of the laser complex while we waited. Overall, we\u2019d try it again but for what you pay, I expect everything to be up & running correctly.",

Matel and disney are kind of like marvel and Disney. You usually side with one. Disneyland has become so overpriced that you have to take out a second mortgage for a family of 4. Hopefully this will have deals for locals and time of year price drops. It's been exciting watching the build.",

There's not a bad seat on that coaster. Water park is pretty solid too. And you can't leave out the beautiful grass and tree shaded parking lot. Great way to beat the heat when you head to the car for a snack or picnic. Very pleased with this park. Wish we could've stayed to see the drag races.",

We chose this place to come from out of town to meet friends who also traveled from out of town so we were bummed & felt our time was kind of wasted, esp for being the middle of a weekend day. We were unable to do go-karts or bumper cars because they were shut down. The bar was closed for the day and we were told we were limited on what we could get from the food/drink area. Our kids played games but when we went to redeem our tickets, the system said we didn\u2019t have any. Again, very sad kiddos for a fun day at the arcade. We all had a blast during laser tag but we were told we had to wait 30min before we could play? It made no sense since there were only a handful of people in the whole place while we were there and no one went in or out of the laser complex while we waited.

Kids love this place. (At least my seven-year-old did. However, in a few years, she'll outgrow the rides.)\n\nTo parents, this place is a great way to spend a few hours visiting City Park, but it comes with a price. It was $21 for our daughter and just over $12 per parent. However, once you pay, you get unlimited rides.\n\nThe rides themselves are old and run down, but the plus is there were no lines on a Sunday afternoon in April. It has clean restrooms and the train is a fun way to see a part of City Park.\n\nNext door is Storyland, a storybook-themed playground that's free.",

Train, Ferris wheel, roller coaster, carousel garden etc are the highlights with 20+ Rides. They\u2019re open from Thur - Sun from 11a-8p and I usually go on Sundays, when there\u2019s no rush whatsoever. The staff consists of teenagers who are super friendly.

                "text": "This little amusement park/water park hits way above its league for big rides.\n\nFor coaster fans, the big draw is its CCI wooden coaster, Excalibur, the biggest roller coaster in Maine and one of the best woodies in New England. (I think it might actually be my personal favorite wooden coaster in the region, though it's not the biggest or most forceful.) There's some nice theming there--the station is themed like a castle, and the whole coaster lies beyond the \"Camelot Bridge\" through a peaceful wooded area. It's running fantastically well now, possibly thanks to a retracking involving Gravity Group's precut wooden track.\n\nThe other big-ticket rides in Funtown include a new and amazingly slick shooting dark ride through the very haunted \"Whispering Pines Hotel\"; a gigantic drop tower; New England's tallest log flume; and the \"Astrosphere\", an indoor Scrambler with atmospheric music, lights and projections. There are also go-karts included in park admission.\n\nThe layout of the place is kind of haphazard and I've heard that this can be a crowd control problem on busy days, but it was not an issue when I visited. The food I had there was not great, probably the park's biggest failing, and it's less well supplied with games and shows than some of the area's other amusement parks. But it's a surprisingly great place to go for big thrills given that it's such a little park.\n\nAs with some other small local parks in New England (but definitely not Six Flags), parking is free. Transit connections to the park, from what I can tell, aren't great. Amtrak actually goes to Saco but getting from the station to the park could be an issue.\n\nIts water park, Splashtown, is quite big for the size of the park--I did not sample its attractions on my visit but my wife enjoyed the slides and pools. It's possible to buy individual admission to one or the other.\n\nIn terms of size, I'd compare the whole place to Canobie Lake Park in Salem, NH, except that relative to Canobie, there is less dry park and more water park, so the sizes are roughly equal. Its atmosphere isn't quite as nice as Canobie's on the whole. But the *big* rides here blow away anything at Canobie; I suspect they are less subject to neighborhood limits.",

On June 24th we took our three girls ranging from 14 to 7, and we all had a blast.\nWe brought lunch with us to reduce some of the cost of the day. You can leave the park if you choose and come back as long as you still have your band.\nThe flow of the park is lovely and not overwhelming. The young staff was very friendly. The park was very clean and well kept.\nFair fees just under $60 per person, for the day (park is only opens for 8hrs).\nBring water! At $4 a bottle, on those hot days, it could add up fast.\nWe do plan on returning on our next yearly visit to Maine.",

Since then, I have taken my own children there, and for the past 2 years, my granddaughter. This year, we went on Labor Day 9/2, and it was so awesome!! She's 2 1/2 this year and absolutely loved it!! This is one of the very few amusement places that have rides for little kids like her. (Funtown does too, but so pricey, and there's no animals.) The costs here are far more reasonable! We did the animal park first. It is very clean and well kept. The animals look content and well cared for, and they are an interesting and varied crew. The goats are the biggest hit with the little ones! The different types of primates are very cool, and some are super funny, too. There's lots more, but you get the idea. The amusement park part is more geared toward younger kids, but there's some decent \"adult kid\" rides as well. The only downside I can think of is how expensive food and drinks are at their concession stands. I mean, I get it. It's a money maker for upkeep and animal care, and probably helps keep admission prices lower. But for your littles, who are a group known to waste food and spill drinks, bring drinks and snacks from home. They are fine with it. They have nice, covered tables to eat at, too. It's definitely an affordable, entertaining, and educational place to spend a few hours!! Highly recommended by this Maine Nana!!",

My 4 year old daughter received a blue wrist band and we rode the 4 person ride without issues allllll day ,multiple times with different lifeguards and workers present. Today I go with family that was in from out of town my daughter was given a pink wrist band. I didn\u2019t pay it any mind on the color never do. Sorry, for the Karen\u2019s that do. Anyway, she rode the same ride 3 times today before we get told on the fourth time she is to short. She began crying because she didn\u2019t understand why we had to walk back down. No one cared there at allll how they upset my child even after I showed pictures and videos of my daughter on that ride. Did she shrink in just a week? The vice president Steve was the worst. For him to be in costumer service is unbelievable. He was so dismissive it was ridiculous. I\u2019ll still be going every year but how we were treated today just doesn\u2019t sit well with me at all and wanted to know my rights or thoughts.  Posting photos of the week previous. How do employees or company hire employees mind you multiple ones that don\u2019t abide by the height restrictions because per jolly Roger\u2019s today she was a couple inches under. I know she couldn\u2019t have shrinked that much in one week. Then I feel like if she was to small why did you put my child In danger multiple times the week before and give her the blue wrist band . It\u2019s not my job to know all your height requirements for each ride.",

We did have a bad experience with the man attending bar in Jjs tavern.  He insisted on harassing us about bags near our table.  We explained they were not ours, yet he berated us about them. We then watched him yell at other families about their bags. Sadly, despite having a great day skiing and snowboarding was shaded by this angry individual. Hopefully he learns to be nice and not tarnish the experience of this great resort.",

Thankfully, there are transport buses available. If you are a thrill ride seeker or a water park enthusiast, then this park is definitely for you. However, the food prices are outrageous, and the quality is not great. Despite this, the time spent with family having fun outweighs the negatives. I recommend eating before and after your visit to the park.",

You can take a shuttle, then it is only about a 300 meter walk.\n\nThey have rides here for everyone. Rides you can take your little kids on, and more crazy rides that may give you a headache!\n\nLines can vary depending on the ride. We went on the weekend on a nice day, and the longest line was 1.5 hours, and the shortest line was 2 minute wait.\n\nOne question I had that I found the answer for:\nYou may or may not be able to bring lose items on the rides like hats, and purses for example. It depends on the ride.\nIf you don't take the item on the ride, you can either put it in a locker which I think costs money, or you can put the items on the far side of the ride in a bucket. Then get it after the ride. The problem with this, is it could be stolen, but you will probably be fine, since you can get it right after the ride, and only people on your ride and staff will have easy access to it.\n\nFood is expensive as expected. About 20 bucks for a burger with fries for example.",

This park has 7 major areas. Main Street, which includes the 1909 Illions Grand Carousel. Rockville, Which has AMAZING theming, but no attractions. Loony Tunes Movie Town, which is an area designed for little kids. Crackaxle Canyon, Which is a western themed area with attractions including Tomahawk, Houdini, and the all new for 2025 Quantum Accelerator! Kidzopolis, which is another area designed for little kids. Gotham City, which has attractions including Harley Quinn Spin-sanity, Riddler Revenge, Batman the Dark Knight, and Joker! And finally, DC Universe, which includes the WORLD FAMOUS SUPERMAN THE RIDE! It has won 5 GOLDEN TICKET AWARDS for BEST STEEL COASTER IN THE WORLD! Another roller coaster, Wicked Cyclone, is also a mindblower with whippy transactions and inversions, which people say that these two coasters are the BEST 1 2 PUNCH! More fun attractions including Thunderbolt, Gotham City Gauntlet, Flashback, Pandemonium, New England Skyscreamer, Scream, and Blizzard River are also worth checking out! This park also probably has the best Waterpark in all of New England with 17 MAJOR ATTRACTIONS! The only negative thing about this park is the parking, which will take you roughly 10-30 minutes of walking to the entrance depending where you park. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend checking out this park if you\u2019re in the area!",

The merry go round is tiny, the fun house looks like a splinter trap for small children, and I'm pretty sure the balls in it were donated from a McDonald's in the 90s and have never ever been cleaned. Ever. There's a birds nest under one of the rides. None of the games were open. The food is SUPER over priced. There were about 10 other families there and not a one had a smile on their faces. The putt putt golf hasn't been updated or maintained since before covid. The signs have been updated to deceive u into thinking u have driven to and walked into fun. U haven't. DO NOT GO HERE!",

Now this isn't cedar point, it's a mom n' pop kinda place, so don't go in expecting it to be on the same level as a major theme park. This is a park with a collection of many older rides, that have been restored to their original (or as close as they can be)glory! Everyone there was so friendly, including the teenage ride operators, who I can tell were kids with good heads on their shoulders, and all love working there! They do take the time to make sure you feel safe, and secure. It wasn't busy when I visited on a Thursday evening, so it felt almost like I was getting my own VIP tour! It's a charming place to take kids, and adults! They have some rare rides that I've never gotten to experience anywhere else! Overall, I'd give it 5 out of 5! Even though a few of the rides weren't operational, I still had a great time! This would be an awesome place for a company picnic, or even birthday parties! Hope to back again soon!",

We did do some arcade games but as usual was pretty expensive and only played for like 10 minutes with about $10 in credits. It's a lot of fun and definitely recommended.",

Go carts were fun and they loved it,  we also loved the glow in the dark mini golf! They games are kind of expensive and it takes a LOT of tickets to get prizes which are not really that great. For $20 each person got 2 attractions and $6 in arcade games. Large parking lot so no issues with parking. They do have food available but we did not eat there. Overall my kiddos had fun and it was ok in price.",

                "text": "Wow, do they take advantage of tourists who only go to the park for 1 or 2 days.  Basically, if you go there more than 3 times, it's worth getting the season pass with the food pass.   We paid close to 100 for 2 tickets,  plus an additional 25$ just to park my car myself,  plus 15 $ for a locker at the water park, and an outrageous 25$ for a single burger, fries, and a drink, and additional 30$ for games.   We waited longer in the food line than at any of the rides.  My son wanted fries.  They ran out of fries twice while we were in line.  It took several minutes each time for the fries to come out.  I was with my young son so I  had to carry the heavy tubes myself in the water park.  Some of the water rides are probably not calibrated correctly.  There are two slides at the end ( yellow and orange )  I caught air on the yellow slide, slamming my back against the slide on the way down.  The orange slide just hurts.  You skid across the water at the bottom, water is hard when you hit it fast.  My butt hurts still hurts 3 days later, and my son has some red abrasion down his back from the slides.  For those into old school costers, the Shivering Timbers is a great ride, especially in the front car.  My son had fun, so I bumped my score up to two stars.",

There was a dinosaur exhibit and really cute dinosaur rides too.  It\u2019s just steps from the zoo, the picnic area and a nice water park, the golf course and Como Lake.  But\u2026.

The staff were friendly and attentive, and we always felt like our kids were in good hands. The attractions were well-maintained.\nNow I didn\u2019t find much food options at the park itself but it\u2019s in a mall so we just took a quick break, walked to the nearest restaurant and had a bite to eat there before going back.\n\nWe ended up spending the entire day there because there was just so much to explore. It\u2019s a fantastic spot for a family outing, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and stress-free day with the kids. We can\u2019t wait to go back!",

It took me 4 years to finally visit this park, and I must say I was impressed at the vastness, rides and overall experience of the park. There\u2019s a huge section for arcade games in the right corner of the entrance area.\n\nI loved the fact that there\u2019s no ticket needed to enter the park. Anyone can enter the park, watch the rides and  use the common amenities. Passes or points are required to get on rides or to access the Paw Patrol Adventure Bay obstacle course and play area.\n\nThey offer seasonal passes which are worth it in my opinion. Took my daughter on back to back days, and she had 4+ hours of fun and entertainment. There are more than 10 rides suitable for kids under 42 inches. They also have characters meet and greet. We got to see SpongeBob and Patrick.\n\nBut seasonal passes a mess. They print with the date of purchasing the pass, not the date of visit. On our subsequent visits the scanners failed to confirm our tags. Bunch of crew members gave us a hard time to get on ride. Some made us wait until they talked to the supervisor, others made it sound like they are doing us a favor. Some told us we were trying to use tags from previous days. Seemed like so many of them didn\u2019t know how the winter/seasonal pass works!!!\n\nVending machines and snack stations are super expensive at the park. A water/soda bottle is around $4, a cotton candy is $13, and bowl of dipping dot is $11. On my second day, there were issues with our seasonal pass. Scanners were not able to verify our passes due to system glitch. A lot of the associates gave us hard time at the entrance of rides. In one case the supervisor had to come and clarify our passes were good.",

The entire place is filthy and coated shoes and sweatshirts in dirt. $10 per person is too much for this place, let alone the $27 they charge.

Some of the other lines were shorter but the last haunted house was 45 minutes again so we only got to do 4 attractions. Very disappointing. We had friends from Texas that came as well and they had to get out of the parking lot line to get gas and use restroom (which there is none until you get in the park) and they didn\u2019t end up getting in the park until 10:38pm (leaving them only 82 minutes in the park till close) \ud83d\ude15 in which they also had 6 people  in their family and got to do 3 attractions. OH, but there was a short line to spend $65 on corn dogs so that\u2019s good.\n\nIt felt like a ponzi scheme honestly! WAAAAAY oversold tickets and the infrastructure simple cannot handle nearly that many people!\n\nI only give it 2 stars because once you get in it\u2019s really well set up and very cool atmosphere.\n\nSuggestions for park:\n-instead of having every car stop and pay for parking, include it in the prepaid ticket so people can drive right in! Seems like the obvious first change.\n-Better system to get into the park to avoid line skipping kids preventing those waiting in back from ever getting in.\n-Offer refunds! If I can\u2019t get into the park for 2.5 hours someone shouldn\u2019t have to pay full price because of the parks ignorance and lack of planning.\n- more staff dedicated to check in",

But driving to Shokopee\nlines of cars to get into the parking lot were very long ... we were in slow traffic while on the highway  for more than 30 minutes, just to get to the parking lot. There were a few families,  but mostly adults enjoying Halloween. The weather was perfect for an October night. There were at least six places to eat dinner, and many pop-ups to buy adult beverages.

The scare actors were absolutely fantastic and made us jump quite a few times. We also thought that the mazes/houses were more creative and immersive than we remembered them. My favorites were the Undertakers, the Boundary Waters, and the 7 Sins (although the 7 sins wasn\u2019t really scary- just cool looking!) We are so happy ValleyScare is back!! Beware of the guests though! We experienced a lot of folks cutting in line, people scaring other guests, shoving or running into people, and just overall not cool behavior! I think this is typical for these types of events though, so it is to be expected and wasn\u2019t that much of an issue. It would not dissuade us from coming again! People will be people, but ValleyScare does a fantastic job. There was also a lot of security and the crowd was controlled very well. We also really enjoyed the Hide and Seek show!! We caught the 11:30 showing right before park close and were super impressed. Hope to come back a second time this year!!",

Upon entering the establishment , we were informed that two rides were down and if there were 3 rides were done we would be offered a discount . We noticed immediately that 3 rides were down ( see pictures attached) and went back to the lobby to inquire about the closed rides and the discount . After speaking with the supervisor Evan ( see picture attached ) he told me that they have a shortage of personnel but that is why 3 or more rides would be closed at certain times . As a paying patron , we paid to have access to all rides except for the ones that were closed . It should have also been disclosed while we were paying to enter the fun park that several more rides would be unable to be accessed due to personnel shortages . We would have not paid to enter the park on 8-1-24 , and the supervisor Evan did not honor the discount for 3 rides being closed . This was a small incident that could have been easily taken care of which I did tell the supervisor , but unfortunately he was unwilling to honor what was stated to us .

Many rides were unashamedly rip offs of Disney rides. No complaints there, other than I believe they could benefit from at least trying to be more creative (even the names of rides and attractions were almost identical). Live entertainment was solid. Definitely a high mark in my book. All in all, a great amusement park.",

It\u2019s best enjoyed with a season passport so you can attend each time they change the park theme throughout the year.  With every change comes new shows, new decorations, and a new experience.  My family has made some of our best memories here.\n\nThere are rides for all ages and thrill seekers.  The gift shops and shows are fun and engaging.  The fireworks display is the biggest and best I\u2019ve ever seen in person.  The musical performances are fantastic.  And, the cave is definitely worth exploring.\n\nIf you can only go one time this year, you absolutely have to go for Christmas.  The lights are truly breathtaking.  It\u2019s hard to describe how incredible they look and the feeling you get just standing there.  There is no better way to get into the Christmas spirit than the warm glow of the lights at Silver Dollar City.\n\nI highly recommend this place for your next family adventure!",

We had so much fun we ended up staying until the park closed.\n\nGoing during Christmas time you'll see the park decorated everywhere with Christmas lights. It's absolutely beautiful and turns it into a completely different place.\n\nThere are plenty of rides and things to do for kids of any age, and if you like rides yourself, you'll have a blast.\n\nThe only negative I can even think of is that it's very hilly. So if you struggle with walking up/down hills you may have a difficult time. But there are plenty of benches and places to rest if you need.\n\nI will be coming back here again, no doubt.",

                "text": "Been going to Silver Dollar City for years. It has an amazing atmosphere, excellent rides, and tasty food. It's also where I proposed to my wife ( by the big Christmas tree). November/December is the BEST time to go to catch the beautiful Christmas lights. I highly recommend doing the Marvel Cave tour while there. If you're up for it, try the lantern tour in the cave. It's a unique experience for sure. If you're a coaster fanatic, definitely try Outlaw Run and Time Traveler. All the coasters are great though. There's also plenty of family rides and rides for the little kiddos.   Another great thing about SDC is being able to watch craftsmen and craftswomen make things right in front of you, and if you like the items, you can purchase them in their unique shops. This could be old fashioned candy, glassware, pottery, blacksmith goods, baked goods or even hand made tools and pocket knives. While there, definitely try a fresh baked cinnamon bread loaf and an apple dumpling with cinnamon ice cream. If you're there around Christmas, you can walk around the park sipping on some hot wassail or hot chocolate. Get there about 30-45 minutes before the park opens for best parking options. In my experience, they usually start letting folks in about 15 minutes before official opening time.",

The Boss and Mr. Freeze were absolute highlights\u2014fast, intense, and well worth the wait! The water park was also a nice way to cool off, especially on a hot day.\n\nThe park was clean, and the staff was friendly for the most part. Food and drinks were a bit pricey, but that\u2019s expected at a theme park. I\u2019d recommend getting a dining pass if you plan to eat more than once. The mobile app was helpful for checking ride wait times and finding our way around.\n\nCrowds can be heavy, especially on weekends, so getting a Flash Pass might be a good idea if you want to hit all the big rides. Some rides did experience temporary closures, which was a little frustrating, but overall, we still got to enjoy a full day of fun.\n\nIf you love roller coasters and a classic theme park experience, Six Flags St. Louis is definitely worth the trip.

Compared to other destinations and theme parks, the pricing is reasonable. It cost about $40 per person for admission and another $40 for parking and there are deals online and elsewhere to get those costs lower. There is plenty of parking although it can be a walk depending on the crowd sizes. The day we visited was not too crowded and we were in the park within a matter of minutes after getting to the gates.\n\nI liked that the park had convenient maps and wayfinding and they even had stations that told you the wait time of the major attractions onsite. This information was also accessible through the app. The lines were reasonable the day I visited and the wait time was no longer than 15 minutes, with most rides having no wait times at all. The food and drinks were expensive but that is going to be at any theme park you visit. It was easy to navigate through the park and there were plenty of places to rest, if needed.\n\nWhy did I deduct 2 stars? During our visit, a several of the major attractions were not working or continued to go down so we did not get to ride them. These being the main reasons for our visit, left us disappointed. I understand the nature of these being down is most likely maintenance and/or safety issues but it seems like something should be done for guests if this is going to be the case.",

One of the clubs I received had broken plastic/rubber protection on the handle end and just had sharp metal ends.

Personally it felt over the top. As a single mom who was there basically wondering around while my daughter and her friends did their thing, I was targeted by every creepy monster that jumped out from behind a bush. At one point I was sitting in a well lit area and a person in a costume came up behind me and crashed cymbals in my ears leaving me in pain and traumatized. I did get some good photos but just be aware if you go with young children do not go on in the evening it is for 13 and above if that.\nI will not go back to this event.",

Pack a lunch in and carry water bottles around to refill inside the parks for free. Travel light and wear shoes because you will be walking a lot. Try to go on weekdays for short wait times. Wait time for the Mamba was 5 minutes on Thursday. Parking is 30$ but you are able to drive over the median (more like a speed bump) if you go in the pick up/ drop off lane for free. Price for entry is 40$/person for both parks. Definitely worth it for how cool the parks are and the quality and speeds of the rides. My favorite rides were the Mamba and the new one called the Zambezi Zinger. The tallest ride in the park gives you an overview of the whole park which is very nice around golden hour. And don\u2019t forget the smaller rides as they were a nice buffer inbetween the big rides because of how intense they were. Go to the biggest rides right as the park opens to reduce your wait times. Oceans of Fun is nice too however the concrete is scalding hot without shoes/ slippers and they won\u2019t let you use tubes unless you\u2019re taking it up for a slide. Great place to take an even number of people for a day trip. Great date spot too if you are prepared.",

The older ones enjoyed the arcades, amusement rides go kart and bowling the younger ones enjoyed the foam frenzy, arcades, go kart and bowling. The food court wasn't too bad, the food was decent and had some good variety.\nOnly takeaway is one has to make extra purchases for arcade games even after paying for the unlimited rides. I feel there should be more credit allowances included in the ticket purchase. I spent $250 on total entrance tickets and only received 10 credits on arcade which equated to one or 2 games on each wrist band.\n\nOutside of this, I would totally take the kids here again, next time in the summer so they can experience the outside water park.\n\nHighly recommended but be sure to read what is offered and purchase accordingly to maximize on the fun.

The pizza was pretty good! Churros was pretty dry. Pretzels and the drinks were good!! Depending on how many kids you're hosting, it's best to bring $100 minimum or more. I can't wait for the water park to open in May. I probably wouldn't go back on a weekend just because it was way too many people. Have to see what a weekday looks like.

The little train they run (wayyyyy too fast through tight corridors literally ran over both of my wife\u2019s feet. (Not sure how that even happens by the way). There\u2019s no tracks painted in the ground or anything. This thing is going seriously hurt a little kid or toddler. Hopefully Phil isn\u2019t too busy trying to sell this thing and hires someone who can operate a decent business here.\n\nTo be honest I absolutely love this place. Been coming here since I was a kid 30 years ago. I\u2019ve never or at least very rarely written a bad review,\n\nbut to see my wife who\u2019s a very kind and patient nurse so outraged by this I just have to write this to hope something changes. I\u2019m absolutely sure this has happened before and the next serious injury will be gross negligence.",

                "text": "Super fun experience! My kids had an absolute blast during our first visit here. The place was practically empty when we went, so there were no long lines at all. They even have a fast pass lane, but we were lucky enough that the kids could ride whatever they wanted without any wait. We ended up staying for more than six hours!\n\nThe park offers a wide variety of attractions, including roller coasters, laser tag, bumper cars, carnival games, carousel, arcades, and other fun rides like gondola, tea cups and airplane rides. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, making the experience even better. The kids had so much fun, what else can I hope for?\n\nWhile it is a bit on the pricier side compared to other bigger theme parks, the experience was worth it. They used to offer per-ride charges, but now it's only daily or annual passes. We didn\u2019t try the food, so I can\u2019t comment on that. However, this is definitely a must-visit spot to add to your list if you\u2019re in Vegas with kids.",

The Midway is also a great place with fun prizes and is a fun activity to share with family and friends. Some portions of the park are a bit dated; however, the rides are well-maintained. It has been over twenty years since I last visited and I was impressed that the quality of the older rides was quite good. The only problem I would bring up is that for some rides, they may not appear to be operating when they actually are such as the Angry Birds ride. Also an exterior window for the dome is still cracked even after 20 years. Other than that, a lovely visit.",

                "text": "**Review of Canobie Lake Park**\n\nCanobie Lake Park is a nostalgic gem that brings back fond memories from my childhood visits in the '90s and early 2000s. Recently, I took my kids for a day of fun, and while the park has maintained its charm, I noticed a few changes, particularly the new closing time of 7:00 PM instead of the previous 9:00 PM. Although this shift can be a bit disappointing for those who love to enjoy the park into the evening, it didn't detract from our overall experience.\n\nThe kids had an absolute blast, enjoying the variety of rides that cater to different ages. While they were a bit too big for the baby rides and too small for some of the roller coasters, there were plenty of \"just right\" options in between. It was delightful to see their excitement as they hopped from one attraction to another.\n\nAs for the food, it was your typical amusement park fare \u2013 think fries, hot dogs, and pizza. Not gourmet, but satisfying enough to keep the energy up for a day filled with fun. I appreciated that I could relax and enjoy a drink while the kids explored. They are old enough to stick together, so I didn't have to worry too much about them running off.\n\nOne thing to note is the price of admission, which is now $65. This is quite a jump from when I used to go, as it was only around $20 back in the day. While it feels a bit steep, I still believe it\u2019s worth it for the memories and fun you create with your family. Just make sure you\u2019re aware of the cost before you go!\n\nThe park was surprisingly not crowded during our visit, and the lines moved at a reasonable pace. Although there was a brief waiting period at one point, it was manageable, and the overall flow of the day was smooth. We made sure to stay until closing time, soaking in the last moments of our adventure.\n\nThe drive to Canobie Lake Park is also a plus \u2013 considerably shorter than trips to larger parks like Six Flags, which is a blessing for any parent. The little in-car entertainment with TV screens kept the kids occupied, making the journey even more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I give Canobie Lake Park a solid four stars. It has retained its nostalgic feel, offering a great day out for families. While I miss the extended hours and find the current price a bit high, the memories made here are priceless, and I look forward to returning again.",

There is literally a ride for all my kids ages and pretty much all 3 of my kids got away with riding everything together (that I was able to fit on too)..otherwise my 10yo was able to bring the toddler on rides with her. Ages 2, 5 and 10 it was a blast. VERY expensive and not practical at all. It's similar to the cost of six flags and for a local amusement park I wish it was a little cheaper so we could go more often. It's always clean there too.",

                "text": "Bee-en There, Done This, WON'T Be Back....\n\nFirst and foremost, if you have a bee allergy, do NOT come here. They are EVERYWHERE and ALL in your face, on your person, in the air. This place is a honeycomb. Sonny's family are HERE! I've never seen SO many bees in ONE place ever and I'm FROM New England.\n\nThis is not an amusement park for the WHOLE family. It's in the name. If you're someone that doesn't ride rides or a grandparent here for the kids, you'll be fine. It's for SMALL kids. If you have a kid under 8, they will love this place. It has cool VIEWS and fairy-tale vibes that my small relatives ate right up. It's a nice public park(?) to walk through.\n\nAnd that's where the positivity dips. We got in early enough and saw a family already leaving. I was like, that's odd. But I've never been here, so I figured the park wasn't big, so they were in and out. That's not the case.\n\nI have a pass that allows me to visit all the parks across the US and yet, I couldn't figure out if we were supposed to bring our home park cup or not. I called ALL of the other parks all week to ask, INCLUDING Storyland and NO ONE answered their phone. Rude.\n\nTurns out, we were supposed to bring our original park cup with us, but from my research online, nothing but our pass gets us in and is transferable, so I wasn't sure IF said cup would work there, so I didn't bring it. I DID try to find out prior to coming. It should be better posted on ALL sites what each park policy is.\n\nAnd with small kids, who wants to get their hopes up for unlimited soda and that's not the case? I figured it's just a cup, we can get one there. No, we can't.\n\nThe staff member was nice enough letting me down and tried to scan my badge to see if I could just get it and go. They also informed me some OTHER parks don't even ACCEPT sister pass cups! Bruh.\n\nIt's giving red headed step child. Do you all not have the same step-dad???!! These parks definitely call him by his first name, Parque. Another staff member at Guest Services was less than polite about informing me that I couldn't get a cup from Storyland, even though I have a pass! It's not the park, it's the person. The Dunkin's lady was super polite about it and didn't make me feel like a criminal for asking. Guest services? Made it seem like I was doing insider trading to their face. It's a CUP.\n\nI get that some people just take to take, so can't give them out Willy Nilly with a budget and stock, but this was off-putting. Corporate Bureaucracy ruins ALL the fun. So that started the trip out on a sour note.  Bless Storyland 's heart.\ud83d\ude43\ud83e\udee0\n\nANYWAY, we walked around the park for Happy Hauntings and some cast didn't care how much you took in candy, but Mother Goose sure did!\ud83e\udee0 The websites all have everyone with these large pumpkin bags and we were given ...a gift bag. Like the kind for treats at a kids party. These are small children. The place is FOR kids. But with adult eyes, there were signs of \"this could be better.\"\n\nThe teacups were fun though. And the train. That's it. It felt like it was an amusement park still being built, because, this can't really be it? Drained pools? The food vendor we went to wouldn't accept our pass for the discount since they said they weren't with the park, but they were IN the park. Go figure.\n\nNew Hampshire really leaned into that LIVE FREE OR DIE motto here. Free to be terrible.\n\nI'm sure Storyland will reply with a very New Hampshire response, but Parques Reunidos may want to rethink this one. It COULD be better managed to make it...more pleasant for all and clearer to visiting pass holders what is and isn't ok.\n\nThe staff were more or less polite to us and it's the policies they're enforcing that are so..... disappointing. But execution is everything. Again, some....were better than others. Dunkin's lady said Storyland accepts sister cups, but I didn't SEE any\n\nBut again, this is through the eyes of a paying adult. My mother was not impressed with Discovery Zone and I LOVED it, so I get it.\n\nThanks for the fun day for my littles, Storyland. Don't call me, I'll call you!",

They have everything, games, rides, attractions, restaurants, fishing, crabbing, water park, gorgeous views, fireworks, live music, festivals, amazing people, soft clean sandy beaches, a beautiful ocean on one side and a beautiful bay on the other side, sunrise, sunset, moonrise, Ferris Wheel, boardwalk food, amazing people, frog bog, jet skiing, surfing, kayaking, boating and so much more. You will never forget your time spent on the Seaside Heights NJ Boardwalk. They have done so much to the area in the last few years and really made it a place to bring the family.  I can't thank the owners of casino Pier and all the town workers enough for the many amazing memories I will cherish forever.",

Lots of options as well .\nThe prices at the gift shop weren't bad either !\nPerfect for a fulfilled family day \u2600\nMost staff was polite & friendly except a few little girls with attitudes (don't get a job if you don't want one) but I'd rate it 4 out of 5 !! Definitely worth the ticket price !!

It has most of the meat when it comes to the park.\n\nThe regular old amusement park is more or less lack luster just been that way. You'll never get a full six flags experience here. But it is a nice local place to visit if you want to get away without going far.\n\nOne big issue Ive had is rides are always down log flume in perticuler. Which sucks because that's the best one in the amusement park side.\n\nTo be honest I wish the whole thing would turn into a water park and get rid of the rides in my opinion. Only reason I mainly go is for water park.\n\nLazy river is relaxing no one rushes you to get out. Food is fine nothing crazy keeps you full. Tube rides are always fun.\n\nNever too many complaints from me but they do have many times where it's just not the best place to be at but it never really happens that often for me anyway.\n\nLike I said worth checking if you local or visiting.",

The older ones enjoyed the arcades, amusement rides go kart and bowling the younger ones enjoyed the foam frenzy, arcades, go kart and bowling. The food court wasn't too bad, the food was decent and had some good variety.\nOnly takeaway is one has to make extra purchases for arcade games even after paying for the unlimited rides. I feel there should be more credit allowances included in the ticket purchase. I spent $250 on total entrance tickets and only received 10 credits on arcade which equated to one or 2 games on each wrist band.\n\nOutside of this, I would totally take the kids here again, next time in the summer so they can experience the outside water park.\n\nHighly recommended but be sure to read what is offered and purchase accordingly to maximize on the fun.

I can only imagine what a Saturday or any other day looks like. I didn't eat before I got there and that was a mistake. I spent a $45 on food! Their nachos with the works is a 10 out of 10. The pizza was pretty good! Churros was pretty dry. Pretzels and the drinks were good!! Depending on how many kids you're hosting, it's best to bring $100 minimum or more. I can't wait for the water park to open in May. I probably wouldn't go back on a weekend just because it was way too many people. Have to see what a weekday looks like. The bowling alley was a nice 30min-1 hour wait. I didn't realize it was a bowling alley until I went looking all the way around the place looking for my folk. This place has something to do for all ages! Super dope.",

A luxury hotel with a possible liquors license? The property now belongs to Eustace Mita.\n\n*you can look up all this info and more on public records of the sale*\n\n5 stars only because this was a lovely place that so many people loved.

While my family has spent many more hours at Playland\u2019s Castaway Cove, we\u2019re very sad to see this iconic park close after the 2024 season. It truly is an icon on the boardwalk\u2014its Ferris wheel towers over its surroundings, and its entrance facade is adorable and nostalgic for those of us who grew up coming to OCNJ every summer. I\u2019m so glad I got to take my first and final ride on the Ferris wheel before Wonderland closes its doors. I just wish I had more pictures and memories to share.",

It\u2019s a small enough park for young kids and they are sure to have a blast! Our boys enjoyed our visits there in previous years and we cant wait to go back this year! We found parking easily every time we have been there.\n\nEdit: we went there on 4/28/24 to the amusement park and had a blast! It was their National Superhero Day event and they had Spiderman and Spidergirl - both of whom were amazing to the kids. It was a perfect spring day and we got to do the rides that the boys wanted - some like the go kart speedway or the bumper cars multiple times in a row. This time, we got lemonade from Holly\u2019s lemonade stand, pizza from Pizza V and a funnel cake to end the day from CJs spot by the batting cages and everything was great! Pizza was better than one you get at amusement parks normally.",

We didn't really care for the Safari ride. Also had a little Christmas touch. A maze, carnival games to win prizes. We did a family visit with lots of kids. It's a whole day experience .

When I asked guest services why wasn\u2019t this communicated they replied\u201d it\u2019s on the signs.\u201d What signs I inquired? \u201cThe signs as you enter the pier\u201d The pier doesn\u2019t s open to 5 I\u2019ve been here since 12. Me:You mean I have to walk down here in advance to read signs for restrictions? \u201cNo the digital signs are posted at all piers\u201d Me: I read that sign like 8 times looking at the confusing pricing. Show me that literature. It\u2019s a digital sign with multiple flashing advertisements, we looked at it for 5 minutes! Finally it flashed in the finest small print I have even seen. Not only that but it lasted for a 3 second count and was buried! The manager couldn\u2019t even read the damn thing because of how quick it lasted. And he works here!!! When asked for an accommodation so my son to ride it was No. At the end of it I brought additional tickets so my son could drive the go carts. This was the main thing he wanted. It\u2019s all about family experience for me. We left afterwards. 4hrs, $250 and a good 12 rides accomplished, I realized Charlatans are offerings family experiences!",

You can pay for better closer parking instead of getting sent to a dirt road as well but limited space. Don't recommend going on the weekend because it is beyond full.

Employees didn't know how to handle the situation because a group behind me made a ruckus about the snake. I'd love to return on a weekday in hope of less people and less wait time on the lines.",

But the walk to the entrance wasn't bad but the walk in the park is very exhausting. Going up the hills to every activity Will drain you out before you even get on the rides especially if you're unfit. The wave pool was really nice and so was the cliff jump. I wish they offered more lawn chairs for the guests to lounge around. The only issue that I have was some of the vendors only excepted Apple Pay and the other vendors only accepted physical card so there is no cash. I wish someone had told me if you had cash on hand you have to go to the lodge and convert it onto a visa card, which is at the beginning of the entrance. I don't recall seeing any signs in regards to this. I will say the price of the food was pretty high compared to a Six Flags considering they didn't have that many attractions. But the admission prices were decent on Groupon.",

If your not use to the walking and using those leg muscles your body will be sore the next day. Not good to go with babies or kids that are in strollers. You\u2019re going up and down  hills , going over bumps, not good to go with strollers. The water is freezing cold. There\u2019s really no where to sit. So bring your beach chairs. We didn\u2019t buy food there . We had a cooler with food and drinks and left it in the car. You can\u2019t bring food in. It is a far walk from the car to the water park but it\u2019s not that bad. We all just walked back to the car when everyone was hungry and came back in. Water shoes are not recommended, but I would definitely wear some water shoes or some crocs. The floor is very rough and hot. You can\u2019t go down the slides with water shoes on they make you take them off, but you can come back and pick it up. I would go back .

This place is a dream for families, especially with young children. From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by how spacious, clean, and well-organized everything was.\n\nThere\u2019s so much to do \u2014 rides, games, arcades, and even mascot appearances during the day. The variety of activities is perfect for different age groups, from toddlers to older kids. My kids loved the mini roller coasters and the soft play areas, while my preteens enjoyed the more thrilling rides.\n\nWhat really stood out was how safe and kid-friendly the park is. The staff were friendly and attentive, and we always felt like our kids were in good hands. The attractions were well-maintained.\nNow I didn\u2019t find much food options at the park itself but it\u2019s in a mall so we just took a quick break, walked to the nearest restaurant and had a bite to eat there before going back.\n\nWe ended up spending the entire day there because there was just so much to explore. It\u2019s a fantastic spot for a family outing, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and stress-free day with the kids. We can\u2019t wait to go back!",

                "text": "Nickelodeon Universe is one of the prime attractions in American Dream.mall, as it proclaims to be the largest indoor theme park in western hemisphere. It took me 4 years to finally visit this park, and I must say I was impressed at the vastness, rides and overall experience of the park. There\u2019s a huge section for arcade games in the right corner of the entrance area.\n\nI loved the fact that there\u2019s no ticket needed to enter the park. Anyone can enter the park, watch the rides and  use the common amenities. Passes or points are required to get on rides or to access the Paw Patrol Adventure Bay obstacle course and play area.\n\nThey offer seasonal passes which are worth it in my opinion. Took my daughter on back to back days, and she had 4+ hours of fun and entertainment. There are more than 10 rides suitable for kids under 42 inches. They also have characters meet and greet. We got to see SpongeBob and Patrick.\n\nBut seasonal passes a mess. They print with the date of purchasing the pass, not the date of visit. On our subsequent visits the scanners failed to confirm our tags. Bunch of crew members gave us a hard time to get on ride. Some made us wait until they talked to the supervisor, others made it sound like they are doing us a favor. Some told us we were trying to use tags from previous days. Seemed like so many of them didn\u2019t know how the winter/seasonal pass works!!!\n\nVending machines and snack stations are super expensive at the park. A water/soda bottle is around $4, a cotton candy is $13, and bowl of dipping dot is $11. On my second day, there were issues with our seasonal pass. Scanners were not able to verify our passes due to system glitch. A lot of the associates gave us hard time at the entrance of rides. In one case the supervisor had to come and clarify our passes were good.",

The kids absolutely love going and usually want to go on the rides multiple times. When it gets dark, the park lights up nicely, as seen in my photos. It's usually crowded, but we still never waited too long for a ride. If you hit the times right like we have sometimes, you don't have much of a line at all. There are food stands such as a Dairy Queen right next to some of the rides, so you don't have to go far. Ticket prices are a bit high, but that's everywhere. I tend to buy tickets when they sell them for half price during the off season, but the kids like to go down so often we run out and need to buy new ones. Tickets you buy one year are also good forever, at least as of last year. There are bathrooms near the log flume ride and aren't the cleanest, but get the job done. It's also easy to find off of the boardwalk thanks to the large pirate sign.",

PlayLand is amazing in that it has all the rides you could ask for, from the thrills, to the kiddy rides, and best of all, at a great price compared to Wonderland. In fact, there are a couple of rides at both lands that are identical, and PlayLand is 1-2 tickets cheaper. When you multiply that by a couple of kids, that\u2019s a huge savings.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is the crowds could be very overwhelming.

The once tallest and fastest Rollercoaster Kingda Ka is the most thrilling ride, even though it last only 45 seconds from launching to stop, some even say only 27 seconds \ud83d\ude11, it is like rocket launches, shooting up right and down straight. Unfortunately after 27 years run, it was exploded early 2025 during closing winter period without pre announcement \ud83d\ude15, otherwise many Rollercoaster needs would take a ride before closing of 2024 season. There are super man ride, riders positioned like flying heroes,  Green lantern ride, players in a standing position. Water park and safari has their own entrance, you can pay in one shot or choose what you want to play.",

A few of the rides were not operational due to another roller coaster being built (which looks like it will be so much fun) but overall still tons to do. We are a family of 4 and 80 tickets was enough for us. The slingshot is an extra $35 to try and the wheel is extra as well but decent prices. The wheel was great to catch some good views \ud83d\ude09 would be pretty awesome at night.

                "text": "We went to Storybook Land (again, have been a few times - including when I was a little kid) to see all their Christmas lights and decorations last week and were not disappointed!\n\nVery soon after it got dark, the lights all kicked on in unison, and it didn't matter where you were in the park because you were surrounded by lights. Plus they decorated most everything they could. It was really a sight to see, and everything was incredibly cute and kid friendly.\n\nOur little 19 month old had a blast taking it all in. We went on a few rides, ate some snacks, rode the train around the park (which you absolutely have to do while they have all the lights up), and enjoyed just walking around and checking out everything that was different there for the holidays. So many decorations, the huge tree near the entrance, the list goes on.\n\nEven though the parking was almost entirely filled up when we got there, we didn't find the park too busy or wait times too long. The train ended up being the longest wait which was still under 30 minutes for us.\n\nIf you haven't been before, note there's many rides that you can take your little one on with you (before they're tall enough to ride on their own). Plenty to keep you busy for hours, including so many animatronic displays with buttons to press to start hearing the \"story\" and watching the display come alive.\n\nOverall, Storybook Land continues to be an amazing place to take your kids, and despite how old it is, they continue to maintain it (several rides looked brand new) and keep it fresh. Your family will have a relaxing and enjoyable time here just like ours.",

Pass on that and go for the stage coach and train rides.\nOld school, cute, fun for kids up to 11 or so.  Really best for ages 6-9.   Dress up in cowboy outfits.  Bring your six shooter, or buy them there. I wish I brought my kids a couple years ago.  The night time version of haunted wild West City seems fun too, probably for the older kids.

One of the main concerns is the pricing structure. Charging the same rate for guests who don't ride as for those who do seems a bit unfair, especially for families who have members that are there just to supervise or relax.\nAdditionally, the selection of rides for toddlers is quite limited. There were not many options that catered to the youngest visitors, which made it challenging to keep the little ones entertained.\nDespite these issues, the park itself has a fun atmosphere and offers a decent range of attractions for older kids and adults. However, with some adjustments in pricing and more toddler-friendly rides, it could become a much more enjoyable destination for all ages.",

They do not put enough ice into the drink, and then you have a warm soda. I did ask for more ice, but the young man only threw in a few cubes.\n\nThey really should install cooling stations with sprinklers because it gets extremely hot walking around. I know they do their best to \u201ccontrol the weather\u201d but misters sure would help like some amusement parks around the country do.\n\nI also recommend more benches and lighting into the bathroom entrances. It is completely dark, and difficult to differentiate between the male and female bathrooms.\n\nWe left as soon the mosquitoes started attacking us, which was about 9 pm.",

                "text": "Not a bad place to visit especially since it\u2019s in Long Island. Not a lot of ethnic diversity either to be honest but still pretty friendly. This place is mainly for kids aged 4-10 years. Lots of kiddie rides and height restrictions like 44-48 inches in order to ride alone or at least with an adult 18+ years of age. Lots of classic carnival games to play like ring toss, basketball shot, water pistol shooter etc with tons of prizes for choose from winning which it should since it is an amusement park. Food is also ok but pricing could use a little adjusting. Plenty of car parking around and they even have special events and conditions for birthday rentals. Bumper cars were kind of boring and the arcades could use a lot more variety in games. Overall I did like the park but gave it 3 star because it reminded me of a much less mundane version of 6 flags. The wait times were the best part as I managed to get through the whole park in 2 hours. Summer time maybe much busier so I can\u2019t really say for certain but this place does have its moments. Some of the rides was actually inspired by 6 flags like the fireball or tornado. The day pass was $40 and came with a silver wristband which looked pretty nice. Bunch of places to take pictures and make memories.",

We went on a Monday so it was not very crowded. The staff was UNBELIEVABLY NICE and friendly!\nOnly down side is that they do not have any restrooms or any snacks or sell water or drinks. Also it is VERY small there were only 6 rides open. The rides are 1 tickets each and each ticket costs $3.50 or you can buy a wrist band for $25.00 and they can ride as many times as they\u2019d like from 11 am until 4 pm Monday through Thursday. I bought the wrist band and it was WORTH IT because my son went on the roller coaster AT LEAST 30 times. If the kids are over 42\u201d they can ride alone if they are under 42\u201d one parent is able to ride with them for free.\nDefinitely recommend especially since the staff are so nice and professional..\nLastly there are restrooms by the ball field which is not very far from the amusement park, they are public restrooms so they are not very clean.",

It\u2019s next to the Queens Zoo and very close to the New York Hall of Science.\n\nFor $25, your child can go unlimited times on all of the rides. Otherwise, you can purchase individual tickets for each ride ($3). There are about 7-8 rides and one game booth.  My two-year-old nephew loved the small trains ride.  He\u2019s on the tall side and the staff made him go by himself since we didn\u2019t have extra tickets for the adults.  If you have children under the height limit, then the adults can ride for free.\n\nThere\u2019s also an old fashion carousel ride that goes very fast!  It was a bit disconcerting how fast they make this carousel go.  If you have young kids, I would suggest you place them go on one of the stationary horses or inside one of the carriages rather than on one of the horses that goes up and down.\n\nThe only food option here is a hot dog stand and a Mister Softee van parked by the entrance of the amusement park.\n\nOverall, not a bad place to spend a couple of hours.  There were just enough rides to keep my nephew happy.  And we got to spend time at the park afterwards.",

The games are set to lose from the mechanical arms on the stuffed animals that our kids love. To all the other games that offer you points towards prizes all set to the lowest setting. So if you have multiple children with you, expect if you choose to go there and not listen to me to spend hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Sorry to blow your bubble kids.

They have some really great slides that are a lot of fun.\nI recommend going on the Curse of the Silverback ride. I probably waited a half hour for this ride in the hot sun but it was worth it. They have a family deal for tickets if you purchase ahead online that offers a pizza, ice cream cones and large refillable soda/water cups for all family members.\n\nThe park itself is massive so it is important to have a system if you are going with a lot of kids to make sure they are all supervised. They have a story time land for smaller kids with older still reenactments of classic stories from the Black Forest.\n\nThey also have a petting zoo which is pretty cool as well. The slides and the water park are spread out pretty much everywhere you go so you can\u2019t miss it.\n\nOn top of all of this, they have a bunch of rides like helicopters, bumper cars, boats, Ferris wheels, and so much more. They also have a live performers at this large amphitheater outside as well, and a train that runs through the park nonstop as well.\n\nThere are beach cabanas for rent and the next time I go back I would definitely get one of those. Having shade during the hot months is something that is going to make you feel so much better because you will be able to enjoy your day more.\n\nAll in all, this is a large entity to take on as just one family but it can a lot of fun. There will never be a shortage of anything to do which is nice as well. It\u2019s amazing that this park has held up so well over the years, the owners really do a nice job taking care of everything.",

The rooms were very basic. We had a room with no microwave, mini fridge or anything special just a small coffee pot. We felt forced to have to buy food and drinks there because of not having the amenities to use for our stay. Overall a quiet place, but we definitely did not appreciate hearing children running through the hall ways late at night or a soccer ball being slammed off the floor for 2 hours. The beds were stiff, pillows flat but the view was great. We loved the theme of the halls, the rustic light fixtures. The view was incredible. Overall positive experience just hope that some minor things can be tweaked for next time.",

The Lego sculptures around the park are great and help with the spread out layout, although be ready to walk. The rides are clean and staff all seemed very nice. We even found the elusive Mr. Gold. The drag is the food, or I would have given 5 stars. It is VERY overpriced, and the quality is substandard at best both in the park as well as in the hotel. Another drawback was that there are very little indoor activities, but overall, if your kids love Lego, they will enjoy themselves.",

Honestly we could have just stayed at the hotel and had the best experience without even doing the park. The service was incredible. Special thanks to Oscar our server at breakfast and Benz at the front desk.  The rooms are so fun and the activities were perfect. The one issue is the food which I know pretty much everyone complains about. I had food at main area in the evening and it was pretty good but the breakfast was inedible! It was truly the worse food we've ever had. They must do better.  But other than the food it was great! The park is a lot of fun and they had a lot of treats. We especially enjoyed the spooky characters.  We will definitely be going back.",

They have some really great slides that are a lot of fun.\nI recommend going on the Curse of the Silverback ride. I probably waited a half hour for this ride in the hot sun but it was worth it. They have a family deal for tickets if you purchase ahead online that offers a pizza, ice cream cones and large refillable soda/water cups for all family members.\n\nThe park itself is massive so it is important to have a system if you are going with a lot of kids to make sure they are all supervised. They have a story time land for smaller kids with older still reenactments of classic stories from the Black Forest.\n\nThey also have a petting zoo which is pretty cool as well. The slides and the water park are spread out pretty much everywhere you go so you can\u2019t miss it.\n\nOn top of all of this, they have a bunch of rides like helicopters, bumper cars, boats, Ferris wheels, and so much more. They also have a live performers at this large amphitheater outside as well, and a train that runs through the park nonstop as well.\n\nThere are beach cabanas for rent and the next time I go back I would definitely get one of those. Having shade during the hot months is something that is going to make you feel so much better because you will be able to enjoy your day more.\n\nAll in all, this is a large entity to take on as just one family but it can a lot of fun. There will never be a shortage of anything to do which is nice as well. It\u2019s amazing that this park has held up so well over the years, the owners really do a nice job taking care of everything.",

My youngest especially loved the little fairytale statues, she wanted to go back 4 times to take pics with them all. Also the rides being included was so nice. We're planning another trip for this summer to bring my sister and her kids along.",

For the food we ordered  wasabi lobster roll of the brunch menu which was delicious in flavor albeit could use a little more lobster. The sashimi was very fresh and the flavor was exceptional. Perusing the dinner menu there are a lot of intriguing dishes. It\u2019s a big place with space for your big parties !",

That created unduly long waits.\n\nThe only truly adult attraction, the roller-coaster, broke down around 4pm. The best water attraction, for most, was closed as well. About half of the shops were also closed.\n\nEven our three and four year olds were unimpressed. Though the 18 month old had great fun in the kiddy pool. Worth maybe a $14.99 admission for adults. Talk about price gouging, kids over 36 inches tall pay full price, yet several kiddy rides would only allow children over 42 inches to ride. Full price doesn't guarantee full access.\n\nDefinitely DON'T recommend! The whole day was just creepy and weird.\n\nBut we parked right in front of the gate and there were no lines to get tickets.",

We stayed at the KOA next door, called to make sure they were open and the train was running to pick us up at the station at the campground got told yes so we bought tickets through the campground.  I then called again while walking to train stop to make sure it was running because the gates were still closed and we hadn\u2019t heard the train yet was told yes it ran every 15 mins.  We waited 20 mins and called again, to only be told that it ran 15/20 mins.  We decided to just drive and not waste anymore time, we get there and there was a sign at the train that said it was not running.  Communication needs attention, notice of how many ride closures posted online and even when calling would be appreciated.  We bought mochi icecream and it was $4.00 for just one little mochi.  The only things positive were the French fries and any staff we did interact with were very friendly and nice.",

The new ownership is definitely doing something right! Sure, some rides are gone but many are still here and in good shape too.\nThe Wild West shootouts are still great! The train and the silver comet still are a major part of the fun. The food we had at the Steak place was excellent. The crowds were light and that worked for us just fine.\nThe saloon had ice cream, a decent beer selection and a stage show.\nAbove all, the adult workers and the younger student age workers were Pleasent and showed a sincere desire to make this a special day for my 12,10,4 and 2 year old grandchildren.\nThere are several rides coming back and new ones on the way.

Be aware that they check your bags and coolers, if you bring them, so you'll stop at the beginning for that. Then if you choose you can stow your items in a locker for a fee. There were some long lines for certain water slides and rides but we had so much fun that we didn't mind. All the rides and slides were so fun. The staff were all polite as well. The show that they had during lunch, with some really talented performers,  was an added bonus, as were the beautiful flower planters around the park. It was a lovely place to spend a day.",

This amusement park is designed so well and kids will love it. Adults can have an amazing time too.. high thrill rides, and great options for food. There was about 10-15 minutes of waiting time for each ride which wasn't bad for a holiday week.  Our favourite rides were Comet, Flashback and Adirondack outlaw. The train and boat rides were super cute! The best part about this park is that the theme park and water park are connected and you can enjoy the best of both worlds, so carry your swimwear! Parking is a little far away and you'll have to walk from there to the theme park.",

                "text": "Review for Frankie\u2019s of Raleigh Amusement Park\n\nWe recently visited Frankie\u2019s of Raleigh, and while the park offered fun activities for kids, our overall experience was disappointing. Before arriving, we called ahead to confirm that the entire park was open, only to find out upon arrival that only one go-kart track was available. We were particularly excited about the drifting experience, but that wasn\u2019t an option\u2014a major letdown.\n\nThe staff was not helpful or informative. When we inquired about the closed tracks, we received vague responses with no effort to provide additional details. It felt like they were uninterested in assisting guests, which only added to the frustration.\n\nWhile some attractions may still be enjoyable, the lack of clear communication and customer service makes it hard to recommend this place. There are plenty of other amusement parks and entertainment centers in the area that provide better service and a more transparent experience.",

There were accidents on every intersection surrounding the place, no fault of their own but still frustrating to navigate. After an additional 30 minutes of driving around we finally get inside and pay $30 to see the lights. Lights were cool. Next we went to take pictures with Santa. No pets allowed inside the building, you had to go behind the building in the freezing cold with no professional camera. Whereas inside was obviously WARM had professional lighting and a professional camera. Absolutely RIDICULOUS to call something a pet event and not make it pet inclusive.

This family oriented park has enough to keep the kids active and entertained with things like 3 pools, including water slides, miniature golf, jump pad, playground, large video arcade, and much more.  They have something like 300 sites and 75 cabins and rent electric carts to navigate the park.  When the Milwaukee airport is landing north we\u2019re under the arrival corridor so the planes fly over at low power settings and the noise level is about the same as the kids make while playing.

No.\n\nWhat I love about this park is its general easiness. No one is waiting long in line, the park isn't so big that you lose sight of your child, the workers all seem at ease, lots of shade underneath beautiful trees, everything is clean,  and there are plenty of places to take a seat and relax as your child runs hither and thither between carousels, bounce houses, swings, and tea cups.\n\nI have fond memories of this place playing wacky basketball and cheating at mini golf, and I feel lucky that I get to share it with my kids.",

But the live entertainment at Cedar Point is fantastic for families as well. They offer a wide variety from large spectacles to smaller scale shows. The coaster lineup here is impressive. But the flat ride collection here is also very large. Hotel breakers is on property and is very nice it is worth the price.

                "text": "Cedar Point is often hailed as the \"holy land\" of amusement parks, and after our visit, it's easy to see why. With the most roller coasters of any park, thrill-seekers are in for a treat, and the park\u2019s location along Lake Erie adds a stunning backdrop to the adrenaline-pumping rides. The views are spectacular, and it's hard to beat the mix of coaster excitement with lake scenery.\n\nWe visited over Labor Day weekend, and arriving Friday afternoon was a smart move\u2014it wasn't too crowded, so we got to enjoy several rides without long waits. However, the rest of the weekend was packed, and we only managed to get on a few more rides. If you're planning a trip during a busy weekend, I highly recommend getting there early in the weekend to take advantage of lighter crowds.\n\nThe roller coasters themselves are fantastic, but we were pretty disappointed that their newest coaster, which we were looking forward to, wasn\u2019t open yet. After driving seven hours, we were hoping to experience it, so that was a bit of a letdown.\n\nFood-wise, Cedar Point offers a good variety. While it\u2019s solid overall, I\u2019d rank it behind Universal, Disney, and Kings Dominion when it comes to theme park dining. Still, you won\u2019t go hungry here, and there are some tasty options. The staff was always friendly, and the park was consistently clean, adding to the experience.\n\nOne regret from our trip is not taking advantage of the exit that leads to the beach on Lake Erie. It looked like a fun way to take a break from the rides, and I\u2019ll definitely try to fit that in on our next visit.\n\nOverall, Cedar Point lives up to its reputation with world-class coasters, great views, and a fun atmosphere. Just make sure to plan around the crowds if you're going on a holiday weekend!",

The glow tubes are something you don't find anywhere, and to have something like this, in a place that obviously is run with guest enjoyment and safety in mind is what makes it a great experience.   The staff was very helpful and courteous and management was on-site making sure the attractions and staff were doing everything they could to provide a great evening of fun.   Policies and information about possible weather factors were clearly posted multiple times and the management even gave us some personal attention on various topics and the overall operations.  Very impressed with Jason's attention to detail and concern for not only his guests, but interactions with the staff members.   Definitely would recommend Fun Times for a unique place and experience not only in the summer months, but for Halloween and the Winter season as well.

I\u2019m not certain of pricing for tickets as we were here for a birthday party so we were given wristbands from the hosts. What I can say is the wristband is good for two hours. We were able to get on everything twice in that time frame. All of the rides are \u201ckiddie\u201d friendly where they are able to get on them without adults. So if you don\u2019t have an adventurous little one I\u2019d recommend bringing a buddy for them to ride with so they aren\u2019t scared. Also another plus that entry is free. You only pay for what you choose to ride on. That\u2019s right grown ups; if you don\u2019t wanna ride you are free lol.\n\nThe concession prices are typical of amusement parks. Typical food options; hotdogs, popcorn, nachos and slushies. I\u2019d imagine on a weekday it\u2019s not as crowded as it was today but even with it being busy; we weren\u2019t in lines for than 5-10 mins. All the staff that we interacted with were kind and helpful getting the kiddos in and out of rides. Overall I could see myself visiting here again.",

                "text": "I've been going to the Columbus Zoo since I was a kid. Now that I have a family, we recently decided to buy season passes (ABSOLUTELY worth it if you plan on going at least a few times a year, even if you don't live in Columbus). My son loves it, I enjoy it. There are so many indoor areas for extremely cold or hot days, lots of animals and educational opportunities. I enjoy the events that they host, and obviously, the holiday lights are great. No other zoo I've been to compares (but I've been fortunate enough to live near Columbus my whole life). Cannot recommend enough. Great for family fun, and I'm so grateful we now have passes so we can go anytime!",

                "text": "I recently visited the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, and it was an unforgettable experience that I cannot recommend enough. From the moment I arrived, the welcoming atmosphere and beautifully maintained grounds set the stage for an extraordinary day.\n\nThe variety of animals at the zoo is astonishing. From the majestic African lions to the playful sea otters, the exhibits are both educational and entertaining. The enclosures are spacious and designed to mimic the animals' natural habitats, ensuring their comfort and well-being. I was particularly impressed with the Heart of Africa exhibit, where I felt immersed in the savanna, surrounded by giraffes, zebras, and more.\n\nThe aquarium portion of the visit was equally impressive. The vibrant marine life and informative displays provided a perfect balance of fun and learning. The manatee coast exhibit was a highlight, showcasing these gentle giants in a serene environment.\n\nWhat truly set this experience apart was the knowledgeable and friendly staff. They were more than willing to answer questions and provide insights about the animals, enhancing my understanding and appreciation for wildlife conservation.\n\nAdditionally, the zoo offers various activities and shows that are both engaging and suitable for all ages. The daily animal demonstrations are a must-see, providing a closer look at the zoo's inhabitants.\n\nIn terms of amenities, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has it covered. The dining options cater to a variety of tastes, and there are plenty of rest areas to relax and enjoy a snack.\n\nOverall, my visit to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium was exceptional. It's a fantastic destination for families, couples, or anyone looking to enjoy a day of wildlife exploration. I left with a deeper appreciation for the natural world and a commitment to supporting conservation efforts. I can\u2019t wait for my next visit!",

The amusement park deserves a 5 stars.  Well maintained and well kept it brought back memories of when I  was growing up visiting Stricker's  Grove.  It hasn't changed a bit!    It depends what day or what promotion the park has for that specific day varies prices and incentives of the park.  ON our visit hot dogs with sides were served & they were great!   All you can drink beer must present ID with arm band, all you can eat ice cream cones, snow cones, cotton candy.  Popcorn oh and pop several different flavors.  The rides were unlimited.  The 2 big roller coasters are always separate from the rest of the rides for instance you can pay for armband unlimited rides or single each times.  Prices vary for events.  I hope my review helps your descion on your future visit to Stricker's Grove.  If you haven't visited you should, you will have a very memorable moment with whomever accompanies you..",

There is also a small water park attached that we did not go in because we did not plan for it but it looks fun. It was a fun day for the whole family there and we will definitely go back.

There are some drawbacks to having your party here. Your guests will have a tough time parking. A few of my guests had to park almost a mile away near the Japanese tea gardens and BBQ restaurant. They were slow on giving wrist bands. If my party starts at 10:00am, then the kids shouldn\u2019t be waiting around for 10 minutes for their wristbands. Especially since we are so limited on time. The contract states we will get wrist bands 5 minutes before our party start time. Also, they said they have a knife to cut the birthday cake but do not cut the cake. So, I was prepared to cut our cake but all they had was a little plastic knife. That\u2019s not a knife and I couldn\u2019t even cut my cake with it. I would tell customers you don\u2019t provide a special cake knife and advise we bring our own. The kids seemed to have fun and of course they don\u2019t notice these things. 4 stars because my daughter loved her birthday and that\u2019s what matters.",

When we arrived the party host asked when we wanted the food I told him 30 minutes and he disappeared after that. We never got our drinks or food till 50 minutes into our party. I could never find our host. I had to track him down. They were sitting in an air conditioned trailer talking and laughing. Multiple parties going on with everyone looking for their hosts. They didn\u2019t give us enough cups or ice for 24 kids. The drinks were watered down and had no flavor. They didn\u2019t tell us that you need to make your guests stand in line at the front ticket station to get measured in height to get their bracelets. The line was long and they had to wait cutting into our party time. They have 5 rides only and one was not working so only 4 options for our kids. Also parking is hard to find since it\u2019s shared with the zoo parking. Suffice to say we will never book a party here again.",

The side ticket shows was not quite what we had expected, but we were still able to do some fun activities. We purchased VIP so we did not have to wait in what looked to be about 30 minute lines. The actual ride selection at the amusement park was limited and there was only ride that we wanted to go on, which I could not ride due to size. Rather than purchasing a $40 bracelet we got a single ride ticket for $13. The carousel and the mini train ride are free to ride. We found parking easily and used the website to pay and skip waiting at the kiosk. Overall a fun little amusement park but nothing special especially for guests of larger size.",

It is so cool that you get the whole place to yourself for a private party. The rollerskating rink is big and spacious and they have a woman that announces during the party and plays games with the children and plays fun music as well. This place offers different food packages and they have an option for unlimited popcorn for all of your guests, which is great because most people love popcorn. I know we do! They also have a separate party room that you\u2019re able to come with your decorations and set up towards the end of the skating portion of the night. You can bring your own cake or cupcakes, whatever you\u2019d like to serve and they offer a pizza place to order from if you\u2019d like pizza. Which by the way, the pizza place that they order from is delicious I will say. The only thing that wasn\u2019t ideal was the location of the bathrooms. The bathrooms are extremely tiny and they are right off of the rink so as you\u2019re skating around, you go right into the bathroom. They kind of sloped down a little bit and the toilets are smaller, so it is definitely challenging with rollerskates on to go to the bathroom. Otherwise, this place is so much fun. The owner is wonderful and all of the kids love it here.\nNot only is the inside so much fun but the outside where all of the rides are is so cool as well. They run all kinds of events there throughout the year like a haunted experience that you can ride a train through the amusement park with all kinds of zombies, walking around the park and other things like couples painting, and skating nights. The owner is always coming up with new and creative ways for people to enjoy the theme park throughout the year.\nDefinitely recommend!",

My friends did not want to stop.they all thought I was telling a tale. So they googled the story. I tell ya they were shocked. Still, we did not head back to see it.\nWhile I was in Easton, I asked Google fun things to do with your pups on the weekend I was visiting... you won't believe this 1st thing that popped up was Doggie day at bushkill amusement park.

The staff were not overly friendly,  particularly some of the young ride operators, but the kids didn't even notice.  Their favorite part of the entire day was the wooden slide inside the old- school funhouse. It was so cute.  Run down but cute.  Keep an eye on your young children, though. There were quite few instances where the operator didn't even notice safety hazards, like when one walked right by my young toddler \"checking\" all were ready to go as she was standing up in her seat out of her buckle already.

Not because it\u2019s the biggest rink but rather how homey it feels everyone there is super kind and friendly it feels so welcoming and the lady at the front running it is so sweet. And talk about inspiring. She got on her skates and it was inspirational. It just shows it\u2019s never too late to roller skate or rollerblade. Would highly recommend this place!!! They also have super fun roller skating games especially for people just starting out you never feel not included. \u263a\ufe0f",

It\u2019s cheaper to buy your tickets online but pay attention to what you\u2019re ordering and WHEN you\u2019re ordering it for. There\u2019s also a waiver you sign online to just skip waiting in any line when getting there. I had a fun time in the mountain coaster for $23. There\u2019s also different zip line courses. During the weekend it\u2019s very busy but in the fall time they have fall fest. It\u2019s cute with themed food and drinks but it\u2019s VERY busy and kind of pricy in my opinion.",

Although we stayed in an Air BNB, I highly recommend considering Camelback Resort for your accommodations - it's an imagine experience!\n\nUnfortunately, our activities were limited due to rain, but we still managed to have some fun on the 1000 ft zip line, which was open despite the weather. This resort is a perfect one-stop destination for all, with plenty of shopping options at the Premium Shopping Outlet and unlimited activities around Pocono Hill.\n\nWe didn't plan to visit the water park since our kids are older, but I'm sure it would be an absolute blast on a sunny day! Overall, Camelback Resort is a must-visit destination for anyone looking for adventure and fun. We can't wait to come back and experience it all again!\"",

Looks just like an old street carnival.\nDon't expect big amusement park because that's not what this is. You have to be ready to step back in time....the rides are oldies but goodies. $18 all day pass...or $10 just for water park. Food prices range from about $3-$5 an item. Small food booths scattered throughout park. Roads and walkways need fixed and patched.\nHotel looked interesting, didn't stay though.\nDefinitely a decent inexpensive day trip.",

The wait to get into the park and to get food wasn\u2019t bad. The longest lines we experienced were for the water slides due to them having one set of stairs for four slides and the line took around 20-30 minutes to get through. The park is stroller/wagon friendly as well as they have free life vests located throughout the water park. Only thing I wish I had brought was a waterproof phone pouch. They have signs that say you need to have them for the lazy river and to basically take them in the water (you can get them for $4 on Amazon).  All amusement rides and water park equipment was in working condition. Highly recommend for kids 5-14",

The water park was fabulous and the amusement park didn't have lines. We have payed double to stand in long lines in other bigger amusement parks ... Which is not too amusing.

There is something for every young age. There was also so much to do and the lines were not terribly long, average wait time for us was 15min. Though there was a lot to do, the park wasn't awfully big. That is a good thing for young kids that are not in stroller and parents pushing stroller. We were not too exhausted to go on more rides.

Although a lot of the concession stands sold your typical pretzels/ dippin dots/popcorn we did find some good spots (I\u2019ll review those separately) but my fave was the pretzel at Penley\u2019s Pub! I also liked how they scanned adults IDs and only allowed 4 alcoholic drinks per ID, no obnoxious drunks at the park that is geared to kids! We also had a baby with us that nurses and the nursing facility for moms was GREAT, very clean, had AC (nice break from outside), a changing station and two rooms with rocking chairs to nurse your baby! I was very impressed with the park overall and it was a nice way to spend the day!",

Sometimes online offers discounted price tickets, parking is $22 or $27.50 (opposite to main entrance). Food options inside the park is not so great, I would expect more options considering this as a family park. Plenty ice cream options \ud83d\ude04! Visit is worth the money and is recommended",

My company was looking for a venue to host about 250 people, and when this location came up as a possibility, I thought it was a fluke.\n\nHowever, I gave them a call, and Tiffany helped me not only put together a wonderful plan but also made every step along the way simple, smooth, and straightforward. Working with Chris C. and Chris L., who run the show, was a genuine pleasure. The whole staff was friendly, helpful, and provided excellent customer service.\n\nNot only was this option a HUGE upgrade from our other choice, which was more expensive and just a blank conference room at a hotel, but they also blew the team away with the huge variety of fun games, duck-pin bowling, atmosphere, and attentive staff. On top of THAT, I only had to bring my laptop for our slideshow! The technology was new and simple, and whenever we had questions, Mark was able to answer and assist.\n\nMy management team was so impressed that they want to bring the whole team back during the summer months to take advantage of the other options as well. It was truly fun for all, and it was awesome to see adults from a Medtech company kick back, enjoy playing games together, laughing together, and just spending time together at this wonderful venue.\n\nIn summary: economical, fun, outstanding customer service, a close-knit team, great management, a great food selection, a variety of games, flexible staff, technology and sound systems provided, and a unique venue for a company event that shakes things up.\n\nA very deep and emphatic thank you to Tiffany, Chris C., Chris L., Mark, Haylee, Gabe, Luke, Jess, Ed, Wayne, and John. From the professional engagement over phone and email to the great senses of humor and bubbly personalities, I was humbled to work with such amazing people.\n\nI am pumped to work with these people again and more than happy to give them my business. Whew! That's a wrap.",

It\u2019s all outside of the park\u2026 I get it - it might melt but no hot chocolate? No chocolate glazed ice cream or chocolate milk shake? No Hersey chocolate any themed food at all inside the park?? So odd!!",

You can go as often as you want in the summer and fall with most of the passes. Their payment plan system they have is great and can make it more affordable for families. Another little thing I wanted to mention. Sometimes we have people in our group that need a wheelchair, and I noticed this year they are offering mobility scooter rentals now, which is great!",

This classic Pennsylvania amusement park really delivers on its promise of being great for families with younger kids. The mix of traditional rides and water attractions makes it easy to spend a full day here, especially during summer.\n\nHighlights:\n- Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood area is absolutely perfect for toddlers\n- SoakZone was refreshing and well-maintained\n- Staff were friendly and attentive\n- Beautiful, shaded park setting with lots of mature trees\n- Good variety of food options (loved the Turkey leg)\n\nPro tips: Arrive early to beat the crowds, bring water shoes for SoakZone\n\nOverall, while it's not the biggest or most thrilling park out there, Idlewild offers solid family entertainment and good value for the price. Perfect for families with kids under 12",

                "text": "Born and raised in PGH. I have been to Kennywood many of times throughout the years. I have to say that I was terribly disappointed with my most recent visit during Phantom Fright. The park is nothing like it used to be. It is very overpriced for the quality that is received. 95 minute waits to get on rides. Hour waits for haunted houses. My family spent over $200 with Groupon discount tickets.  Unfortunately, the park was so over crowded that we only rode just one ride. We only got to experience 3 haunted attractions. That is pathetic! They now offer you to pay more money to buy a fast pass that allows you to skip the longer lines. This is on top of what they charge you to enter the park. Sadly, the employees appeared to be truly miserable. They were unfriendly and visibly uninterested. KW used to be a loved family park full of traditions...a true staple in the Burgh. But, you can tell that it jumped on the bandwagon of trying to keep up with other thrill parks. While doing this...it lost its nostalgia of the pure authentic fun that it used to be! The templated response to guest reviews shows how KW doesn't value its guests. I will reach out as they suggest and I will give an update in the near future.",

They even got a chance to wave back at the characters, which made their day extra special.\n\nThe rides were just as enjoyable. Whether it was the gentle rides for the younger ones or something a little more thrilling for the older kids, there was something for everyone. They had a blast trying them all, and I loved seeing them so excited and full of laughter.\n\nBut the real fun began when we headed to get in the pool. They absolutely loved the water and my grandkids didn\u2019t want to leave. It was the perfect way to cool off and enjoy even more excitement.\n\nSesame Place delivered an unforgettable day for my family. It\u2019s a perfect blend of fun, nostalgia, and adventure.

Neither of my children religiously watch Sesame Street - however, they are familiar with the characters and enjoyed the character experiences.\n\nThe line for security to enter the park was long but moving. We had \u201cMagic Queue\u201d passes to pick up in the Welcome Center upon arrival and the line was not moving. We ended up going to pick them up in the \u201cGuest Relations\u201d office where the line was moving along more steadily.\n\nWe visited on a day where many of the water park attractions were not opened yet re slides. I believe the children would have enjoyed it more if the slides were open. The layout of the water attractions versus rides is very \u201cunique\u201d and they are in several different sections versus one designated spot.\n\nWe enjoyed the Dining with Elmo event as it was extremely kid friendly and the kids were freely able to jump about, dance, and move without it feeling as though they needed to be seated the entire time. The food is extremely casual but it was good.\n\nThe Parade on Main Street fills up very quickly and there are very few shaded areas. The pavement gets extremely hot so bring a towel or blanket and plenty of water.",

                "text": "Visited on March 28, 2025. Friday.  Around 1 pm.  With another adult and my two visiting grandkids, 5 and 7 years old.  Military group.\n\nSaid I saw on-line cost to unlimited rides is $30 with military discount, for kids, at the pay booth.   Two individuals in inside the Pavilion amusement ride booth said no, cost is $39, a large $9 more.  One person, a tall young black male immediately said that\u2019s \u201cold information\u201d on the internet.   He knows this?  Or just says to stop my questioning?\n\nThe other person, a black female said that\u2019s not us, those are \u201cother people\u201d selling.   I asked well if we buy from these \u201cother people\u201d with the 25 percent cheaper price how does that work when we arrive to the park. How does that work, what do we do when we come to the park, what is the process ti get in and ride the rides? She said she didn\u2019t know, \u201cthat\u2019s them, not us\u201d   Who owns the rides?   The park?\n\nThe problem:  Feel thus organization, this business,  just looks to scam people, as I see other complains have been noted about this park on the reviews here.   They simply lie to you, (old information).  Or,  one\u2019s just getting vague information, or no information at all, when the women said she has no idea how buying tickets on the internet works when coming to the park, nor what the process is, and projected an attitude she simply didn\u2019t care, so don\u2019t bother asking me.\n\nBottom line, as a paying customer coming to this child ride park for the first time, I don\u2019t have any faith in these two people being honest or providing accurate, trustworthy information.   Zero.  No faith in this business.  All grandparents want is  good, accurate information when taking the time to do something for our kids.  No BS talk and a feeling the business is a greedy and dishonest and have their employees project this.\n\nSecondly, found the workers in the park running the rides lacking any energy and providing inattentive customer service and communicating very poorly.\n\nExample:     My kids rode the race cars ride with the sharp turns on each end.  Next to it was the Cup ride.   No workers were at that ride.  Nobody there, vacant, no worker people.   No signs saying it\u2019s shut down.\n\nSo I asked a lady who was at the race car ride   Is the Cup ride next door operating?   She said nothing!  No greeting. No eye contact.    She simply pointed to two worker women sitting at a bench between the Cup ride and the Carousel (horses) ride.  I had no idea what\u2019s she was communicating to me.  She didn\u2019t talk!   Did she mean, go talk to them?   Get them to get up and go man the ride like they should have been doing?   No idea.   So, my kids never got to ride the Cup ride, and they wanted to ride this ride.  You people really messed up here.\n\nHorrible customer service. Horrible.  And where is the supervisor, when you gagged to employees sitting on a bench and nobody is manning the Cup ride?   Why does he or she allow this to go on, this lazy work behavior/horrible customer service  to take place?   Workers who can\u2019t even talk to customer grandparents to provide basic information.\n\nParents, grandparents who are considering coming to this park, maybe their first the, take note of my comments.  They are all true.  Take note how well I have described my experience at this park.  The detail.\n\nFor me, with two small grandkids who love rides like any 5 and 7 year olds do, who will be coming to visit me for years to come in Myrtle Beach, I will never, ever waste my money at this park again.  Never.\n\nThere\u2019s other child ride parks in the area that will gladly take my money.",

                "text": "If you ever have someone deride South Of The Border as a whole as a washed-up, abandoned place, they're more than likely thinking of this part in particular. As much as I love South of the Border, Pedroland Park has seen WAY better days.\n\nBut first, a bit of history. While I'm sure it was abandoned, there used to be a roller coaster here. From what I can tell wandering around the park, I don't think the roller coaster was the only ride that was taken down.\n\nHowever many rides this place may have had at one point, the only three attractions you'll be able to use are the bouncy houses, the playground, and the miniature golf courses. That's perfectly fine by me, as the miniature golf courses are probably the only thing that my age demographic would want to use.\n\nLord knows when most of these motorized rides were last functional. The playground actually looks like fun, but the inflatable bouncy houses look rather worn out.\n\nFor years now, I had wanted to play at the miniature golf courses, and I was told that this place is only open during the summer. My first issue is the limited window of availability, as the miniature golf courses did not provide a lot of shade, but you're only able to play at these courses out in the ninety-degree heat; which will only get worse as climate change gets worse every year.\n\nAll the signage says that it costs $8 to access the entire park, so one positive about this place is that the attendant only charged me $4, AND because it is essentially an all-access pass, I didn't need to pay anything else to play the second course!\n\nThe golf courses themselves are in rather rough shape, as one of the holes is SUPER DAMP AND WET, and a lot of them have torn up carpeting, and in some places, the AstroTurf is absent altogether, but you could tell it is supposed to be there! If that wasn't enough, the actual holes have weeds growing in them, areas with water flowing are dried up, and the places that do have water look like a good spot to get Cholera. The attendant did warn me about the quality, and I did know this going in based on other people's reviews and photos, but I was determined to play these courses someday, as I had wanted to for several years.\n\nBelieve it or not, the poor conditions of the miniature golf courses were not detrimental to me or my score. The courses do not have any sort of par listed, and there is no scorecard, but I was still able to make most of the holes in three shots or less, and the course's roughness practically never interfered!\n\nBut like I said, it was hot, and I do not recommend playing these two courses back to back like I did if it's going to be at least ninety degrees; especially when the real feel temperature was 101!\n\nI didn't ever feel nauseous, dizzy, or feeling like I was about to faint, but I think the heat did make my heart rate increase rather rapidly, and I could tell that I just NEEDED to get out of the sun; even though I was only out there for an hour. The two courses offered very little shade, and I had to rush through the second course a little quicker than I would have liked to, so I could get out of the heat ASAP.\n\nThere is a vending machine with cold water in the park, but that only did so much, as I still went over to the gas station and bought a Gatorade afterwards, as my arms felt tight from what must have been electrolyte loss. Besides, the vending machine costs $1.25 for a drink, and it doesn't seem to like quarters, so bring $1 bills.\n\nI'd most certainly be willing to come here again and play the golf courses again, if they were open during a cooler part of the year.",

We walked in for my nieces 10th birthday party last night, only to be jumping for 10 minutes before a disgusting and vile fight broke out between a ton of adults who also involved their children in the fight. This fight went on for over 15 minutes before security, any of the employees, or police stepped in! Fighting and cussing and being disgusting right in the front lobby in front of all of the staff who were blatantly ignoring them and subjecting every child there to this trauma. When my family member asked for a refund for the $500 birthday party she just paid for, the staff refused and only agreed to partially refund her her money. They made her pay for jump socks and 4 pizzas that we weren\u2019t even able to utilize and still kept over $200 of her money! Everyone who checked in at 5pm were forcibly removed from the premises, but if you had reservations at 7pm or later, you were allowed to come back and jump. My niece\u2019s entire birthday party ruined for some ghetto disgusting fighting. Even more disgusting that all the staff and security just stood there watching a huge fist fight break out in their lobby in front of all these children! You will NEVER get my money again dirty fun city. Do not send your children here they are not safe!!!",

The staff at the front told my guests that they needed to check in with the host in the party room and would get their socks at that time. Every time we would have to hunt down a host who then needed to go and find our host. They never asked what size socks the kids needed just gave them some and left the room. My guests had to go back upfront to get a different size because they gave them all small. They only provide one juice or one water per jumper. So if parents want something to drink they charge you $2.00 for a water and because we went on a weekend they charged $2.50. Their website says that the host will help with set up, service and clean up. They did not do any of that. While we were doing cake a host come in the room and took the utensil/plate/napkin hold her. I advised that we were not done and they responded with \u201cI\u2019m taking it to refill it\u201d. It was returned after we got done. While picking up the room a staff member come in and asked who to give the bill to. While we were carrying things out someone else come in and asked us if we were using the card on file to pay the bill. They then walked me to the front counter to make sure we paid.\n\nVery poor customer service. Would not recommend having a party here.",

Roller coaster down the side of the mountain, zip line, gunslinger, rope obstacle course, and cave tour. Great place to take your kids to have some fun. The roller coaster doesn't go super fast, but it's a scenic ride down the mountain. The zip line was pretty cool.

I chose this park over Rushmore Tramway Adventures bc our son just misses the cutoff on some of the attractions. I will say the coaster is so fun and safe compared to comments I\u2019ve heard from friends that have been on the Alpine slide at Rushmore Tramway. The wingwalker challenge allowed our son to be accompanied by an adult as long as he was over 42\u201d but if your child is under that height then there was a nice challenge for younger kids so they are not left out!\nTook 4-5 hours for us and we brought a picnic which worked out great.

Plus they decorated most everything they could. It was really a sight to see, and everything was incredibly cute and kid friendly.\n\nOur little 19 month old had a blast taking it all in. We went on a few rides, ate some snacks, rode the train around the park (which you absolutely have to do while they have all the lights up), and enjoyed just walking around and checking out everything that was different there for the holidays. So many decorations, the huge tree near the entrance, the list goes on.\n\nEven though the parking was almost entirely filled up when we got there, we didn't find the park too busy or wait times too long. The train ended up being the longest wait which was still under 30 minutes for us.\n\nIf you haven't been before, note there's many rides that you can take your little one on with you (before they're tall enough to ride on their own). Plenty to keep you busy for hours, including so many animatronic displays with buttons to press to start hearing the \"story\" and watching the display come alive.\n\nOverall, Storybook Land continues to be an amazing place to take your kids, and despite how old it is, they continue to maintain it (several rides looked brand new) and keep it fresh. Your family will have a relaxing and enjoyable time here just like ours.",

The tree canopy walk was a highlight, offering a unique perspective of the forest. The variety of activities, including the zip line, observation tower, and charming shops, made for a fun-filled day. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, and the food at the mountaintop restaurant was delicious.

Did nearly everything, non add on and was back down 6pm.\n\nVisited on a Wednesday, last week in March.\n\n60+ degree and sunny weather helped make the waiting tolerable.\n\nAt the top was a very unique \"small city\" experience. The views!!!! Beautiful! Very clean, lots of restroom options and at least one water bottle fill station. Also lots of seating.\n\nA few snack options such as flat bread pizza and ice cream that we found.\n\nWe did:\n\ud83c\udf43 tower\n\ud83c\udf43 slides/bearventure\n\ud83c\udf43 treetop sky walk\n\ud83c\udf43 gift shop\n\nTook time to enjoy all the views! And redeem our photos from the ride up.\n\nOverall unique experience for our teens. Would say for other families considering, meant for elementary and up. Or great for adult day out!\n\nParked in city garage for $10, about one block away.\n\nIf we were to do it over again, probably would purchase zip line tickets (allows express chairlift line) a week in advance (sells out quick), as well as, the night light walk AND not go up until 4pm or 5pm. There was no wait to go up when we came back down at 6pm.",

The pictures don't do it justice just how steep they are. That said, the coaster felt very safe, even while going full speed. I really enjoyed the thematic elements and the creativity of the coaster. It was a much longer duration than other mountain coasters in the area, and the price is reasonable. I highly recommend this coaster, just be aware it can be intense for people who don't love heights. I suggest going at off-peak hours so you aren't in a queue with other riders.",

The best part is you can control your speed so if you\u2019re not a roller coaster person like myself no worries! I had my eight year-old son in the cart with me and he thoroughly enjoyed it! We got the package to do mini golf afterwards, even though it was cold, it even started snowing, we were having so much fun it didn\u2019t matter! The facilities were very clean as well! my daughter and I are very big on stones and crystals, and they are undeniable options for you to purchase those here! I grabbed a MotherLoad bag of fossils stones and crystals for my daughter. The first day we came! I was a bit hesitant because I thought maybe there were a bunch of little stones in these bags of dirt , but for $25 you can\u2019t beat what you get out of these bags ! I definitely went back and grabbed another one before we left !!! I don\u2019t have one negative thing to say about this place! We will definitely come back and visit this place for sure.

It never gets old and continues to get better and better each and every time I come. Must try the cinnamon bread, I would get the VIP parking.. it helps you beat the long line at the front entrance, you have your own parking lot, you can go in and out of the park as many times as you want. Take enough money for food and souvenirs(it\u2019s all expensive and you can\u2019t not help yourself when you start smelling all that delicious food cooking). Bug the souvenir cup so you can refill it as many times as you like. Be sure to go by the Dolly Museum and her tour bus on the way out.. it\u2019s cool to see her clothings she has worn and other memories she let us in on in her personal life! This place is better than Disney World (my opinion)! Almost forgot.. say hey to the chicken lady!! She is the most kind hearted, funny woman at the park.",

I look forward to going back soon.\n\nThe roller coasters were great, the lines were reasonable, and we had a great family day.

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s honored all year but when we went the wristbands were good for 48 hours! If you lose the wristband, you can get a new one for $5 with your receipt. The gondola Ferris wheel was unnecessarily expensive. Wrist band holders get on for free but otherwise it\u2019s $17 a ride. If you want to buy tickets for your kiddos, as a parent you ride free for any rides that require  a chaperone (your kid doesn\u2019t meet height requirement to ride solo for the ride). Parking can be challenging but they have shuttles for the free parking lot. We brought 3 young kids under the age of 5 and there were surprisingly quite a few rides for our 2 year olds, though none were solo.",

We purchased our tickets the day prior but still had to wait in line with one attendant. Maybe two attendants would have been helpful. One for people who need to purchase tickets and one for people who purchased ahead of time. This place has the potential to be superior. However, you can tell some things do need major upgrades. First and foremost, the ice skates for kids are extremely used and need replacing. My kid had fun, but the ice skates were so bad and very difficult to put and stay on. We got to ride the coaster and only waited about 30 minutes. The attendants working this attraction were very vigilant and working well to get the line moving. The views on top of the mountain on the chairlift are absolutely breathtaking. This place needs to sell healthier options. For example, acai bowls, smoothies, or salads.  The food is very pricey and tastes like regular cafeteria food. I recommend bringing your own food. I do think the wristband is worth the $50 bucks because we got to do everything and spent all day from 10am- 4:30pm.",

Taking the tram up to the building will sway, so I would drive up the mountain and park there instead if you have a fear of heights. There is a lot of things to do here, including an entire skiing park with chairlifts and real snow. There is also a scenic chairlift where y or can see as far as North Carolina. There is a mountain coaster that is pretty lengthy and fast, although lines can be as much as 90 minutes long. There is much more to do like Ice skating and bumper cars. Overall, this place is good. I probably wouldn\u2019t go here again on spring break because much of the things you can do there are closed, but in the winter this would be a very good skiing place in the eastern part of the US.",

We remarked many times how friendly every staff member we encountered was and how it really made our day.  Our son begged to go back every day of our trip! Getting to go back three days was a huge plus and we felt it was a good deal because of that. It was never super busy so we felt more relaxed than any other attractions in the area.

The view was breathtaking. My favorite thing that we did there was pictures with the highland cow Dozer. If you love the mini cows, you have to do this. They offered hay rides, and they were also expanding the ranch. On the way back down, we rode the shuttle and the driver told\nus stories about the animals and how long he had been there and facts I found so interesting. That was a fun end to an amazing moment.

There were bunnies, baby goats, miniature highland cows, baby pigs, miniature horses, and sheep.  We didn\u2019t get the hayride to feed them but we still got to pet all the animals at the ranch. There was live music.  The cafe had awesome baked goods and icecream.  They had fire pits, a playground, cornhole and an outlook.  We went at 6pm.  I think it would be be more enjoyable in the evening bc then the fire pits are going and they have a lot of lights which makes it even more enjoyable.  We rode the mountain coaster at the end when it was dark bc the track is lit up.  We only have a family of three so for us it was worth it.  We had a lot of fun and would definitely go back.  Major plus is that your tickets are good for three full days!!!",

You can also order food and eat at the bar, there are tables too.\n\nThere is also so much to do outside. You can really make a day trip out of this place. The game tokens and tickets are stored on play cards, so you can save them up. They have package deals too for rides, the buffet and experiences.\n\nIf your child is over 44\u201d plan to pay adult prices. It was busy when we were there. But they were also having an event and many kids were on spring break.\n\nGreat for parties, events, family gatherings and an all around good time!",

There are some drawbacks to having your party here. Your guests will have a tough time parking. A few of my guests had to park almost a mile away near the Japanese tea gardens and BBQ restaurant. They were slow on giving wrist bands. If my party starts at 10:00am, then the kids shouldn\u2019t be waiting around for 10 minutes for their wristbands. Especially since we are so limited on time. The contract states we will get wrist bands 5 minutes before our party start time. Also, they said they have a knife to cut the birthday cake but do not cut the cake. So, I was prepared to cut our cake but all they had was a little plastic knife. That\u2019s not a knife and I couldn\u2019t even cut my cake with it. I would tell customers you don\u2019t provide a special cake knife and advise we bring our own. The kids seemed to have fun and of course they don\u2019t notice these things. 4 stars because my daughter loved her birthday and that\u2019s what matters.",

I could never find our host. I had to track him down. They were sitting in an air conditioned trailer talking and laughing. Multiple parties going on with everyone looking for their hosts. They didn\u2019t give us enough cups or ice for 24 kids. The drinks were watered down and had no flavor. They didn\u2019t tell us that you need to make your guests stand in line at the front ticket station to get measured in height to get their bracelets. The line was long and they had to wait cutting into our party time. They have 5 rides only and one was not working so only 4 options for our kids.

The only thing we saw were dolphins and Beluga whales.\n\nAs it was our first time seeing either, we took everything in stride. We spent about 10 minutes with the whales one of which was a cheeky bugger :) who kept trying to wet his good natured caretaker.\n\nThen, we went back and spent a good while with the dolphins. I believed I was able to connect with one as it was a see through tank. They pass right in front your face and of course they love small kids and babies.\n\nSuffice it to say, it's because of the dolphins and whales that brought the score up. Please Marineland, do better. Get things up and running quickly. The venue is lovely, but a lot is missing..",

It\u2019s designed to accommodate individuals of all abilities, making it a fantastic place for families and friends to enjoy together. One of the things I absolutely loved was how seamlessly everyone interacted, whether you had a disability or not. There was no sense of separation. Everyone played, laughed, and enjoyed the park as equals.\n\nThe wheelchair accessibility was phenomenal, and even those with mobility challenges could experience the rides, which is something you don\u2019t see at most amusement parks. The covered picnic area was another highlight\n: clean, spacious, and perfect for relaxing between activities.\n\nMy only downside was the restrooms near the picnic area. They were small, with only two stalls, which led to long lines. If you needed to assist someone with toileting or changing, there really wasn\u2019t enough room to do so comfortably. I hope they consider expanding or redesigning that space in the future.\n\nOverall, Morgan\u2019s Wonderland is an incredible place that fosters fun and inclusivity for everyone. I highly recommend it to families looking for a park that truly welcomes all.",

It may be worth it to get a ticket that includes at least one meal. There are quite a few places to eat and choose from and the portions are decent. One bottle of Smart water was $10 with tax.

Six flags coasters in order of best to worst. Sit in the front, definitely a unique and amazing experience.\nIron rattler - overall most exciting ride in the park.\nDr diabolical - extremely smooth ride. Get in front.\nGoliath - smooth and no wait.\nBatman - newest ride and very unique.

My kids were able to blow throw 200 credits each in less than an hr. Which ended up okay bc the lines for everything else were sometimes an hr long.

Seeing her light up with excitement was priceless.\n\nOur 22-year-old son, who is nonverbal and has CP, absolutely loved all the games. He was engaged and happy the entire time, which made the experience even more special for us. And my wife? Well, she found her own fun\u2014she was completely hooked on the coin-pushing machine!\n\nIt was a day full of joy, laughter, and unforgettable memories.

However, it\u2019s worth mentioning that some of the games and the arcade area itself felt a bit dated. A little refresh would definitely take the experience up a notch.\n\nWe were excited to check out the bowling alleys on the second floor, but unfortunately, we ran out of time. From what we saw, it looked like a great addition to the fun, so we\u2019re definitely planning to try it out on our next visit.\n\nAnother great perk is the plenty of free parking, making it super convenient to visit without any hassle. \ud83d\ude97\n\nOverall, Tom Foolerys Adventure Park is a great spot for families with kids, and even us adults couldn\u2019t resist joining in on the fun!

                "text": "We go to Tom Fooleries fairly often. Usually we have a decent time.\nHere are a few complaints and I hope by making this review, corporate will take our suggestions seriously.\nFor families who have young ones under 42inches tall, you get a $20 wrist band. They literally can only do 1 ride alone. The small rollercoaster and large Carousel , they have ti be accompanied by a paying adult which is $45. Not even an older child (we have a 12 year old) who had a $45 wrist band.\nThey also can\u2019t do go carts even as a passenger with a responsible paying adult.\nThey have mini rides but those are credits, 12 credits for the tea cups which equates to roughly a $5 game card\u2026\u2026\u2026 1 min ride, it\u2019s just mind blowing to me\nAlso the arcade, good luck finding anything under 10 credits to play. I bought a $10 game card and got 1 game out of it because it was 12 credits and the game needed two people.\n\nIt also highly bothers me that they have attractions (human claw) that require credits. As if you don\u2019t pay enough with the wrist bands as it is\u2026\u2026.the lines are long and it\u2019s not fun to wait 30 min in line to be told you can\u2019t do it, employees enforce these rules like their life depends on it, there is zero leeway.\n\nAs a parent, I don\u2019t personally want to do any of these rides, but I\u2019m forced to. They need to revamp their rules here, it\u2019s a small theme park, it\u2019s not that serious. They also need to re-evaluate how many credits these arcade games cost. It\u2019s pretty much $5 per game, which is ludicrous.\nThanks for coming to my ted talk.",

                "text": "Great value. Activities are limited there are very few rides and they eliminated at least half of the video games they previously had. That being said for the price it is more than worth it. The entry fee includes go carts, a few rides including some water rides in warmer months, all the video games including a flight simulator, a rock wall, and I'm sure a few other things I'm forgetting. Concession prices are lower than most amusement parks and the staff is always super friendly. I highly recommend ZDTs for any family looking for reasonably priced fun. I would definitely rate 5 stars if they had more rides but they have so few it feels wrong to call it an amusement park.",

                "text": "We attended the Big River Christmas last night. It was fun but could have been better. The thing we were looking forward to the most, the bouncy house, was soaking wet inside. And they weren't telling anyone this, just letting whole families go in with their toddlers and nice clothes on to get absolutely soaked. We were lucky to have arrived at the entrance right as a family came out and the family warned us with a chuckle that it was wet inside, the woman glancing at me miserably to let me know they were understating the issue (she was soaked). The amusement rides were fun and included in the price, the staff with them were all so sweet and cheery. The food was ridiculously overpriced and not included in the price, so eat before you come. ($9 for a tiny chili dog) ($5 for below average hot chocolate). The only food I can recommend and was worth it was the festive holiday funnel cake, it was so fun! Picture included here. The hay ride line was long (30 minute wait) and fun but alot of lights were broken or missing. They need to do an audit of the hay ride lights, many are not working at all. There didn't seem to be any management present and the lack of oversight really showed. When we arrived the christmas lights out front on the main entrance building werent even lit. Axe throwing was awesome! 20 minute wait time and you sign a waiver. Archery line was way too long so we skipped it. We never found Santa and got lost in a wooded area looking for him. The paths are not well lit, I couldn't see any maps either. I was only able to find the restroom by screaming \"has anyone seen a bathroom anywhere?!?\" The actual maze was our favorite ride/attraction. Make the maze bigger, we loved that! Lafittes Fury was a fun ride, I recommend going to the bathroom first. Take deep breathes like your giving birth and you wont have a heart attack.\ud83e\udd23 2 amusement rides were broken. The gift shop was underwhelming. The price for this event online was $25 per person. I would say it was not worth that price if I had paid that. I received my tickets as a gift and only paid for food. Lines for rides that got long weren't really controlled by barriers or staff and there was some cutting happening and some angry dads yelling in a few spots. Paired with alcohol this seemed bad. Again I did not see one adult employee anywhere managing anyone. ALL THIS TO SAY WE WILL DEFINITELY RETURN FOR THE SUMMER. The lazy river looked fun and that massive climbing course thing seemed really unique and we want to try that out during the day in warmer weather.\ud83d\ude04\u26f1\ufe0f One last thing, it might not mean alot but our family notices these things: I am pleased to report that this entire park seems extremely disability friendly and ADA compliant. There is seating everywhere, wide paths and ramps. So bring your grandparents and your disabled friends and family.\ud83e\uddbd\u267f\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d",

We loved the hay ride, lights, petting zoo and rides.\n\nThe only issue we ran into were the fairground attendants seeming miserable. I wanted to ride the small airplane ride with my special needs daughter, she\u2019s a little bit anxious so she wanted me to sit with her- but she was excited. I only weigh 138 but the girl running it wouldn\u2019t let me ride with her\u2026 there were no weight limits listed or height, and then later on I see a teenager who clearly weighs more than me on the same ride. It had me feeling like it was some weird form of discrimination, idk. I felt icky after that. I know the part time employees are not a direct reflection of the core of this park so we will definitely be back, I just want the owner to be aware this happened, as it caused my daughters overall mood to decline after we couldn\u2019t get on.\n\nShe still rode her first ride ever, the Texas twister and she had a blast.

The poor girl handling our party was also handling a few other parties alone, which is pretty stressful. She did a wonderful job of remaining calm and doing her absolute best to handle all our needs as fast as possible. I definitely think there needs to be a manager handling the parties with the employees because that was way too much for just one person. We had fun but a lot of stuff was broken or out of order and the lines were ridiculously long (understandable due to lack of staff). We didn't even have time to try everything because we were running so late on our party due to the lack of staff and only having 2 or 3 staff members running it all by themselves. We wanted to do the Go-Karts but so many of them didn't even work that the line wasn't moving very fast. Very disappointing. I wouldn't mind going here again if they repair things and hire some more folks, but they definitely should repair their broken things, and hire more staff or this place will be run into the ground in no time. Not worth what we spent due to the complications and lack of working machines/Go-Karts/etc. And you have to wait in line regardless of purchasing online. They should have a separate line for online purchases to move lines smoother and faster.",

The older ones enjoyed the arcades, amusement rides go kart and bowling the younger ones enjoyed the foam frenzy, arcades, go kart and bowling. The food court wasn't too bad, the food was decent and had some good variety.\nOnly takeaway is one has to make extra purchases for arcade games even after paying for the unlimited rides. I feel there should be more credit allowances included in the ticket purchase. I spent $250 on total entrance tickets and only received 10 credits on arcade which equated to one or 2 games on each wrist band.\n\nOutside of this, I would totally take the kids here again, next time in the summer so they can experience the outside water park.\n\nHighly recommended but be sure to read what is offered and purchase accordingly to maximize on the fun. If you have older kids, the amusement, go Kart rides and bowling is all you need.",

The pizza was pretty good! Churros was pretty dry. Pretzels and the drinks were good!! Depending on how many kids you're hosting, it's best to bring $100 minimum or more. I can't wait for the water park to open in May. I probably wouldn't go back on a weekend just because it was way too many people. Have to see what a weekday looks like. The bowling alley was a nice 30min-1 hour wait. I didn't realize it was a bowling alley until I went looking all the way around the place looking for my folk.

                "text": "Gravity Park is an absolute must-visit if you're in South Padre Island! From the thrilling reverse bungee to the classic Ferris wheel with breathtaking views of the island, this park is packed with fun for all ages. The go-karts are a blast, and the mini-golf course is both challenging and enjoyable. The giant stick thing was amazing too, probably the best thing! The only downside is that the prices can feel a bit steep, especially if you're planning to enjoy multiple attractions. *You can only pay to go on the rides once* that said, the quality of the rides and the unforgettable memories make it worth every penny. It's the perfect spot for families, friends, or even a fun date night! We'll definitely be back next time we're on the island. Gravity Park truly adds to the magic of SPI!",

It reminded me of a premium theme park without the huge admission price. It's free to walk around. Tickets are sold to ride the rides. And there are lots of benches to sit and watch the action. The rides are clustered together but it all seems orderly. There's an adorable train that weaves its way through and around the various rides. Restaurants are intermingled about the property as well. The actual boardwalk itself butts right up against Galveston Bay and affords a lovely view. The only thing that struck me as a shortcoming was the lack of public restroom facilities. For patrons not dining in one of the several restaurants, I only found one and even the Men's room had a line to get in. This is a very nice, family friendly park ready to make some nice memories for it's guests.",

                "text": "A Hidden Gem for Big Time Family Fun!\n\nWe had the most wonderful day at Mainstay Farm! This place is an absolute treasure for families with little ones\u2014and honestly, fun for the grown-ups too. From the moment we pulled up and saw the colorful Ferris wheel and ladybug-themed car, we knew we were in for a treat.\n\nThe Easter-themed attractions were adorable and festive, with plenty of photo ops and things for the kiddos to explore. Our little one was obsessed with the animals\u2014chickens, bunnies, sheep, goats, and even cows! The petting zoo area was clean, shaded, and just so sweet. Each animal had its own little charm, and the staff was so patient and kind with the kids.\n\nThe mini train ride was a huge hit, and the Ferris wheel gave us a great view of the whole farm. We also loved the big trampolines\u2014they wore our son out in the best way. Food-wise, everything we tried was tasty and fresh. You can tell they put love into every part of the park.\n\nIt\u2019s also a Christmas tree farm, so we\u2019re already making plans to come back during the holidays. The staff was friendly and helpful all around. Mainstay Farm is the perfect mix of wholesome, Texas-sized fun. Highly recommend for families looking to make sweet memories together!",

I was AMAZED, I did not expect that even I would have an awesome laughter filled night! From a moms perspective this is what I noticed, First of all the arcade and rides area is totally FOOD FREE, you actually have to Look for the dining and food area, which is a huge bonus when you have small children with food allergies!, Secondly The establishment was CLEAN, it was not like many other places we have gone that are crammed in to to small a building and not properly maintained. Thirdly but very very importantly for us Old school parents was the Staff presence, they were Great, accommodating, quick to fix issues with games, no long process just oh here lets replace your points! The amount of staff really changed the whole atmosphere, it was not a Herd of screaming, misbehaving, unattended children! It was a Huge well spaced area of Fun where the children acted appropriately (While still having a blast!), waited their turns and did not run thru adults etc. Maybe it was just the late night timing but I will never pay more somewhere else when this center gave us such a great experience!!! The rides are great, not 2 minutes n over, but 5 minutes and little if any \"lines\" except the mini bowling.  We did not try the food, but with allergies we never will anyway so I cannot comment there but all around ITZ abq was one of the best experiences all around we have ever had at any fun center, clean, respectful, and Insanely fun! small price to pay for great memories! Classy all the way, even at closing time when the boys couldnt decide what to buy with their tickets, the staff did not get rude or rushed, and the 11 yr old said it was EPIC x3! You get MORE than you pay for with the late night special!",

                "text": "Avoid this unfortunate excuse for an arcade. The games are over priced, you are required to buy food or a useless pass, and dealing with hovering people for 4 hours is not my idea of a good time.\n\nI'm not sure where to start.\n\nFirst off, if you are a small child or have small children you may enjoy it.\n\nIssue number one: only two days a week after 8pm can you go and only play the games offered. Otherwise you have to buy their buffet food too. I didn't have a chance to try the food but I find that premise ridiculous.\n\nSecond issue:I don't believe it is possible to go there without some sort of pass (late night pass for us, which included 5 dollars in credits to pay ticket and prize based games plus unlimited rides, bowling and shooting/racing games. Which sounds pretty cool until you see the types of games they have).\n\nLargest issue: THE GAMES ARE TERRIBLE.  There are actually few games that you can actually pay on with the unlimited pass. Most of the games are the more entertaining, ticket and prize based games. All of the games for unlimited pay are rather old (4+ years and some I haven't seen for 10+ years), a good portion do not work or have parts that don't work (sound, buttons, etc), and In general there aren't enough games for every one to play comfortably.\n\nI may not be 100% accurate with my claims, so be sure to check on their website if you doubt me in any way.\n\nP.s. we did have fun playing DDR and guitar hero.",

You can tell the park is very new and well kept! Lines were short, so the kids were able to ride the daddy pig roller coaster many times!

Their Pizza is really good, a must try I would say. Other sides are good too, we tried dipper fries and tinders. I wish they offered a couple of dipping sauces but we were the last order so staff might have been tired of up selling already! I would have given it 5 stars but Leslie on cashier didn\u2019t bother to give enough information on the difference between packages and timing that I need to go to attractions that I booked! More of a figure it out yourself attitude. I ended up paying $240 for a family of four while not using most of the attractions! Also Google maps wasn\u2019t accurate, they close at 8:00 not 9:00, always check their website. On the other hand the manager on duty was nice to give us 4 Blue cards without an expiration date to come again as a make up for the misunderstanding.",

The tickets are fairly priced for all that is included in them, and you can easily spend 5+ hours here.\nI was also very impressed with the quality of food. Typically these kind of places have low quality food at high prices. We ordered a full sized pizza (for under $20) and the kids burger. Everything tasted amazing and looked delicious.\nWe visited in January and the temperature inside was comfortable. They do have lockers on site to hold belongings. The staff was friendly and helpful for all needs.\nI definitely recommend giving this place a try when looking for active fun!",

Worked out cheaper to buy an annual pass than a day ticket plus parking so ive been twice in a week so far. Some really good coasters..... New Texas Giant and Titan are incredible! Pandemonium is a lot of fun too. Theres several big thrill rides but loads of family/smaller child friendly stuff too which is great. Id personally recommend the Flash Pass to give you an allocated ride time. The park is clean, rides are spread out and theres a whole tonne of food/drink options available including free soda refills if you buy one in a six flags reusable cup. Absolutely recommend checking it out!",

We had a last minute travel plan changes and we couldn't go to the park the day we wanted to.\n\nVarieties - we have been to three other parks before but this takes the gold as to the inclusive of age and heights of kids. There is something for every young age. There was also so much to do and the lines were not terribly long, average wait time for us was 15min. Though there was a lot to do, the park wasn't awfully big. That is a good thing for young kids that are not in stroller and parents pushing stroller. We were not too exhausted to go on more rides. The water park was fantastic! Lots of seating area for everyone.",

Parking (even in the non-preferred) was very close to the entrance still and easy to navigate in and out of- although a little pricey in my opinion $20. The wait times on the rides were very reasonable and there is a great variety to choose from. At one point they even had a dance party with the dragon and princesses in costumes and a bubble machine! Although a lot of the concession stands sold your typical pretzels/ dippin dots/popcorn we did find some good spots (I\u2019ll review those separately) but my fave was the pretzel at Penley\u2019s Pub! I also liked how they scanned adults IDs and only allowed 4 alcoholic drinks per ID, no obnoxious drunks at the park that is geared to kids! We also had a baby with us that nurses and the nursing facility for moms was GREAT, very clean, had AC (nice break from outside), a changing station and two rooms with rocking chairs to nurse your baby! I was very impressed with the park overall and it was a nice way to spend the day!",

We went when they were running the fall special online for tickets and it was pretty well priced for what it was. They had a pumpkin patch, a petting zoo, some rides, games and a corn maze. We went during fall, so obviously they were doing Halloween and the scary corn maze, but they also do things during Christmas and Easter as well. The kids really enjoyed the candy cannon which shot candy out for all the kids to grab. The food that is there in the restaurant/store was good as well but if you didn't want that they also had a couple food trucks.",

We went for the Halloween event and the story was super fun. We could become knights, or witches among other things. Each had their own 3 step quest line that kept you talking to the workers. You could tell the workers really enjoyed what they were doing. They stayed in character and made interactions really fun. The decorations are sweet and for $21 per ticket for adults it\u2019s well worth it. They also had a bird show that had some rare birds and cool facts. and some shops if you\u2019re interested in that. The offer food and snacks but we didn\u2019t purchase any of those. I would suggest getting there early and signing waivers beforehand. It\u2019ll save you time. It took about 24 minutes for us to get from the end of the line to enter to getting in.",

We bought combo tickets in advance and had to wait in line to get in because apparently entry was free on the night we went.\n\nThere were no explanations or maps on how to redeem our experiences - each seemed to have its own method  and taking a picture of the map by the front entrance wasn't helpful. The big map had names scratched off or didn't have the same names as the events. Fortunately someone in our group had been to the park for a different event and knew generally where things were. The park isn't large and is a loop.\n\nThe decor is quite good and the storytelling experience was lovely, with quality performances and scenery. The performers were the best part of the park. However, the ice skating experience was a joke. There was no skating, just walking/prancing on plastic sheets in dull skates. The train was not operating for the night. The wait for hot chocolate and an overcooked churro donut was 45+ minutes only to be told that they were out of hot chocolate and offered apple cider instead. We could've waited another 15 minutes for hot chocolate. The other activities (archery, knife/hatchet throwing, and battle (not part of the combo pass) were lacking and underwhelming.\n\nThe shops and craft booths were nice, but small and disjointed. There were stages and other venues that went unused.\n\nThis place has so much going for it, but fell flat on its face in terms of execution. It is a beautiful park. I hope that they can improve on the experience - there is so much potential.",

Even though we enjoy all the rides we grew up on, like Colossus and the wooden roller coaster, we also enjoy all the new rides like Wiked and Cannibal. This was our first time coming here since the new ride Primordial opened. It was a long line, and we waited over an hour to get on. It was a blast, a little roller coaster mixed with a 3D interactive video  game. We also enjoyed eating in the Biergarten. The food there is much better than the regular carnival fare, but it's a little pricier too. We also like to wind down by walking around Pioneer Village, where it's a little quieter and laid back. All in all it's a great place to spend the day with family and friends and you can find something for everyone.  We just usually run out of time to be able to see everything and do everything we want to do. Just wish it wasn't so expensive, but they have no competition for 100s of miles.",

                "text": "Went to Ricochet Canyon at Gardner Village. It used to be only a seasonal thing, but now it's open year round! It was a nice little place to take small children for a fun outing. It's entirely enclosed, so you don't have to worry about littles wandering. We took 3 little kids (ages 3, 6 and 8)  and they loved it. Favorites included the little roller-coaster and the pony ride. There were picnic benches with shade umbrellas (which was nice since it was a hot day).  It's next to all the shops and events center. Parking immediately  outside the park. Admission and petting zoo are free (but you can buy a cup of feed to give the animals). You can buy individual ride tickets or stamp passes (see photo). The employees were very friendly and attentive.  (Review written July 23, 2024)",

The family can experience petting some animals, pony rides (the short or long version \ud83d\ude09) a rollercoaster, and train rides in the old west. You can practice your roping skills and have the kids explore a little old west town and get out some energy. There\u2019s the Happy Camper deli nearby just a walk away in Gardner village that has some delicious items for lunch and bakery goods.\nWe love it here and that some of the staff are younger kids that are caring for the animals and putting in hard work.\nThe ponies are our favorite!!",

Complete JOKE with several attractions closed for maintenance and the others closed for a wedding - with ZERO notice when you purchase tickets. We waited through a line for the Mountain Coaster so that the EMPLOYEES could take turns going on the ride themselves (pictured), just for them to only let half of our group go and close it before the other half could. They lied about having a military discount - which we also didn\u2019t find out until after we bought tickets. Their solution for all of this? A $10 \u201cBrighten Your Day\u201d voucher. We had to talk to 3 different people and wait through a line twice just to get the tickets refunded.

The buildings matched and the aesthetics were nice. The food was what you would expect from a theme park standards $$$. We went to have ice cream and they were out of a lot of options.\nStaff didn\u2019t seem excited to be there. They weren\u2019t rude just didn\u2019t seem happy. The park was celebrating \u201cmember appreciation\u201d but I\u2019m not sure there were many whom felt appreciated from talking to locals in the lines.\nAgain maybe everyone was still in winter mode lol. I would maybe try again but not sure it\u2019s on the top of my list.",

Use the Busch Gardens app to just pull up and go. Security is a breeze and if you are a pass member, you can have your photo tied to your account or show id at each visit.\n\nWhat else can I mention, the park is beautiful and clean always and vendors are full of surprises. We visited as a family of 6 and everyone had a good time. My favorite places to eat are FestHaus and New France's smokehouse. As with all theme parks, prepare to bring your wallet. BG is cashless, but there are few places in the park to turn cash into a prepaid card. You can refill in the park as you go. I used that as I do not like using my debit card everywhere. Overall, it's Busch Gardens. I love visiting and purchased a membership just so I can visit whenever I have a little extra spending money \ud83d\udcb0",

We visited after in winter time, and I was very pleased to see there are heated sitting ares through the park and multiple fireplaces scattered around the park as well! The rides were on, but we skipped them because of the lower temperature. But there are there for the brave! Check the schedule ahead at the time and on the day! When we bought the tickets online, the schedule was from 10 am. On the day, when we checked,  the schedule was from 2pm-10pm. It was perfect for us because we didn't care about the rides, and because of the cold weather, it would be too long to walk so long in the park. But from 2-10pm, was the perfect length to enjoy the daylight and the  Christmas lights! My favorite show: GLORIA!",

We were there at park opening, and the wait time to get on the rides was minimal to none. We were able to ride most major rides, some twice, had lunch on-site, and we left the park mid afternoon. Pantheon was our favorite ride, followed closely by Griffon and Tempesto. We were amazed by how clean and beautiful this park is. I would definitely return.",

I thought the ride would be longer and take you farther up the mountain.  That being said, I loved it and was smiling during and afterwards.

It sells out fast so you need to get tickets as soon as you can.\n\nI wish we would have gotten the deal for 2 rides, but we ended up getting a second ride because the person in front of us was breaking the whole way and it slows you down so you don't bump. When we got to the exit, they offered us another ride to make up for breaking the whole ride. For the most part they can control waiting on the person moving slow so they don't keep sending up riders until that person has gone through. You can also request to have a slower ride and they'll time it out for you. Going slow the first time was kind of nice because I got an idea for how it worked and got to enjoy the sights. I'd suggest getting two rides overall because it is so much fun.\n\nThey have 2 places you can get food (first and third floors) You can also buy a s'mores pack to make at the fire pit out front.\n\nYou can't take bags on the ride so we left ours at home, but we saw people leaving their stuff on the second floor where you get on and then coming back for it right after their ride.\n\nI highly suggest trying the alpine coaster!!!

My family and I went to this restaurant for lunch and at the time of paying I swiped my card and the cashier asked me for my card to swipe it again because the payment couldn't be made, I didn't see a problem, but now that I see my account From the bank, I see that in this restaurant they charged me, in addition to what my purchase receipt said, $50 more dollars for two more meals that I did not order and do not appear on my receipt. Apart from that, he had given me the incomplete order. Well, but the kitchen did solve that, which was a missing sandwich. But the collection of those $50 dollars, that was a blatant theft. And now I can't complain because, obviously, I no longer have the restaurant ticket\ud83d\ude41\ud83d\ude20 because I had thrown it away after leaving this place.

I will say though that $20 for a 4ish minute ride is somewhat expensive.  The only discounted option is to by a two ride pass for $36, four dollars off the second ride, but only when you purchase the first ride, you can't go back and get the $4 off. I thought the ride would be longer and take you farther up the mountain.  That being said, I loved it and was smiling during and afterwards.

It sells out fast so you need to get tickets as soon as you can.\n\nI wish we would have gotten the deal for 2 rides, but we ended up getting a second ride because the person in front of us was breaking the whole way and it slows you down so you don't bump. When we got to the exit, they offered us another ride to make up for breaking the whole ride. For the most part they can control waiting on the person moving slow so they don't keep sending up riders until that person has gone through. You can also request to have a slower ride and they'll time it out for you. Going slow the first time was kind of nice because I got an idea for how it worked and got to enjoy the sights. I'd suggest getting two rides overall because it is so much fun.\n\nThey have 2 places you can get food (first and third floors) You can also buy a s'mores pack to make at the fire pit out front.\n\nYou can't take bags on the ride so we left ours at home, but we saw people leaving their stuff on the second floor where you get on and then coming back for it right after their ride.\n\nI highly suggest trying the alpine coaster!!!

I was so irritated about the bag policy because it wasn\u2019t outlined anywhere that\u2019s easy to see on the website. It\u2019s the smallest bag and every single person in line had a diaper bag, backpack, or like us, a tote with extra kids clothing and snacks/drinks. They made us walk all the way back to the car. Thankfully, we had a wagon so we could keep our stuff. Most people couldn\u2019t and there were some pretty upset moms with diapers and wipes that had no other way to carry them. Our 10 year old had a mask on with his costume and he wasn\u2019t allowed to wear it so we had to walk that to the car also. Most of the rides that were open, our 10 year old was too tall to ride and the 3 & 4 year old required an adult, which was fine but the height requirement that allows kids to just go alone is so narrow. Kids 36\u201d and shorter require a parent and kids 42-48\u201d are too tall for the \u201ckid rides\u201d.\nMy 4 year old was so excited to see zombies but we left around 7 pm and didn\u2019t see one scary \u201cmonster\u201d so he was disappointed.\nWe were there from 230-7 and the lines were pretty short, even on a Saturday.\nAll in all, worth the money, but check your bags and remember there is no masks or full face of makeup for kids over 48\u201d.\nThere was also no trick or treating and only one person had a bucket of candy.",

Honestly, if you plan on going more then once then its a no brainer to get a season pass.\n\nWaterpark - There is plenty here to do for water play. There is a huge wave pool with cabanas for rent around it, lazy river, kid zone water area with mini slides, and multiple areas with water sides. On warm summer days expect long lines for the water slides. They do have white lounge chairs setup around pool areas though you will want to get there early to get a seat. Everytime I took my daughter and her friends there was always multiple life guards watching over pool areas and I feel they do a good job. This is a good place to bring the kids or friends/family to cool off on warm summer days.\n\nPark Rides - This is the frustrating part. There is a decent amount of attractions here. Two big coasters and a variety of other rides for everyones liking. The issue I have is that there is always....always alot of rides that are not running which is disappointing because on some days its the ones you were wanting to ride. Example is the timber hawk ride, I think I actually seen that ride running twice out of the countless times I have went. Not sure if this is due to staffing or maintenance but it should be looked into and figured out. Being a season ticket holder I feel as though I am not ever able to get the full experience or value due to this issue. The wait times and lines are not too bad for the rides on some days.\n\nHousekeeping - No complaints here. The park is pretty well kept and bathrooms have not been horrible the times I have been there.\n\nFood - Food is pricey but that is to be expected  when eating at any theme park. You get a good deal on drink refills when you get a wild waves big bottle. I suggest you bring a water bottle with you and eat before you go or bring your own snacks.\n\nStaff - The staff is primarily a bunch of younger kids/teens probably first jobs or just summer jobs. Some do well working the rides they are tasked to operate while others dont take control and call people out for not following rules, cutting lines etc.\n\nSeason Pass - Great value though I do want to point out that when it states it includes 2 friend/family passes that is mainly for weekdays. My daughter brought her friend with her on a  Saturday and I had to end up paying 42 bucks for her as the friend/family pass didnt cover weekends and that is not clearly outlined on the website. Just a heads up so you can avoid that frustration.\n\nIts nice to have a local theme park to visit for rides or the water park. Not the best but its still a good time with plenty to do. I would still recommend to go and experience it.",

It goes to show that when things are taken care of, they can last for a very long time. Then again, today's products are take built like they used to be.\nThere are new rides there as well that are cool.

Tickets are 25 cents per ticket, and no ride is more than 4 tickets. This place is especially fitting for smaller children, but I think it would be fun for teens and older people alike. Bring your own picnic to enjoy at the many picnic tables. You can also bring grills because they have hot coal bins available. There is a small and very reasonably priced snack concession stand offering hot dogs, cheese pizza, various sized soft drinks, pretzels, popcorn, cotton candy, and a few ice cream novelties. I bought a hot dog, 32oz soda, large popcorn, and a pretzel with cheese, and it came to $18.25, which I thought was a good price. Lines are longer in the afternoon, but they move quickly. Almost all the rides are accessible if you are able to walk a few steps to get onto the rides. Unfortunately, these are older rides, so not all body types will fit comfortably on/in them. There is disabled parking at the front where the big white building is located.",

They have a tiny kitchen and need more efficiency in the staff.\n- mini golf course was fun (if brutal) very good design! Needs to be cleaned and have a few repairs to the greens.\n- restrooms .

                "text": "I have stayed in bad hotels before, but this was by far the worst experience of my life. We were there for just one night, and it was nothing short of a nightmare.\n\nWhen we arrived, we checked in and went straight to the indoor water park, which was extremely disappointing. The water was dirty, and the entire place had a terrible smell. We were told that our room would be ready by 4 PM, so we waited. When we finally received our room key, our plan was to go straight to bed with our 2-year-old and 3-year-old so they could nap before we continued our evening. This was the primary reason we paid extra to stay at the hotel with the indoor water park\u2014to ensure convenience and avoid cranky toddlers.\n\nAt 4 PM, we attempted to enter our room, soaking wet with two exhausted toddlers. However, the door would not open. We tried multiple times before calling the front desk for assistance. A staff member arrived but was unable to help. Another technician came, also with no success. Eventually, the manager showed up and suggested that someone might be inside the room, as it seemed to be locked from the inside. After forcing our way in, we realized that the main door lock was broken and needed to be replaced.\n\nWe were given two absurd options: either stay in the room the entire time and only leave at checkout (because if the door closed, we wouldn\u2019t be able to get back in) or leave the door open. We refused both options. They assured us it would be fixed in 15 minutes, but 1.5 hours later, they admitted they needed to call someone else. By this time, it was already 5:30 PM. Another technician arrived and worked on the issue for another hour before finally telling us there was nothing they could do, and we would have to sleep with the door open.\n\nThis was completely unacceptable. I insisted on being moved to another room near our family. Instead, they relocated us to the opposite side of the hotel, forcing us to carry all our belongings while juggling two overtired and crying toddlers. My husband and I were beyond exhausted and frustrated.\n\nWhen we finally reached the new room, my little boy needed to use the restroom. The moment he stepped inside, he slipped and fell badly. We then noticed that the ceiling above us was leaking, and the entire bathroom floor was covered in water. We had to take him to a doctor, and we are now considering legal action due to the extreme negligence and inconvenience we endured.\n\nThis was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. The lack of proper maintenance, poor customer service, and complete disregard for guest safety are unacceptable. I strongly advise against staying here.",

                "text": "Where do I start! First of all this is not a resort. This is a scam that this hotel is using to get more money from their guests. A resort should be a home away from home. This is not that. My room was ready upon arrival which was great but when I entered the room it was covered in dust. There was a glass table/lamp in the far corner of the room that I could write my name on because the dust was so thick. My daughter who is 8, pulled the blankets back and the bed was covered in black curly hair. So we all ended up sleeping in the other bed together . They do not offer coffee or tea in the rooms or in the lobby. Nor was there any body lotion which being a water park \u201cresort\u201d you should offer to your guests. My 1st night there an employee changed the garbage outside at 2am and slammed the trash and the door to the outside closed. No respect for the guests whatsoever. The people above us were so loud, until well after 3am. It seemed more of a party and get drunk motel than a resort. I was in building 10, they had mattresses in the garbage area, which reading the rest of the reviews tells me they also had a bug issue in that building. The walk to get to the water park was ridiculous. It was a confusing maze. We had a cabana for one of the days, there was a server who was supposed to come to us when we rang the button. It was a 45 minute wait before they would come. We ended up just going to get our own food and drinks. The life guards were not even paying attention half the time and I never saw a supervisor in the pool area. My daughter said Great Wild Lodge was better, and honestly with the \u201cresort\u201d fees you pay at Mt. Olympus it\u2019s ends up being about the same price.",

After calling the front desk, they relocated us to Building 1, which is connected to the water park.\n\nThe first night was fine, but Saturday night was a bit rowdy in the hallways. However, the real disruption came at 2:30 AM when we were all jolted awake by the fire alarm. With temperatures around 15\u00b0F, we had to bundle up and wait in our car for about half an hour. Strangely, no fire trucks arrived\u2014only four police cars and later a single fire chief\u2019s vehicle. They eventually silenced the alarm, but no clear explanation was given. From what we overheard, it was supposedly due to a \u201cwater leak\u201d\u2014quite the leak if it managed to wake up hundreds of guests in the middle of the night.\n\nThere was also no staff directing the evacuation (people were jamming up the stairs, had it been a gas leak etc things could have gotten bad) or informing guests if it is safe to re-enter, we walked back in once it was silenced 30 minutes later. After talking with some staff the next day it came out that kids pulled an alarm lever.\n\nThe next day there was a brawl at the water park and 3 police cars returned not even 12 hours later, this time adults got kicked out.\n\nAs for the water park, it was okay but very crowded, the spin slide was fun and we will go back but doubt we will stay at the hotel again.\n\nOverall, the experience had its ups and downs, but the unexpected wake-up call and lack of clear communication from staff left a bad impression.",

                "text": "Yuck, yuck, YUCK! I\u2019m so disappointed with this hotel and water park I would absolutely not recommend it to anyone. The level of dirtiness, disrepair, and lack of amenities just makes it a terrible experience. I\u2019m lying in a bed here wishing I was back home.\nWe got early check in, and discovered we were in building 10 (out of like 24 buildings). When we came to our room, we were greeted with all sorts of debris and garbage in the hallways, like crumpled up dirty socks and chewed up gum. I thought maybe they just hadn\u2019t vacuumed yet because we were early, but it has stayed that dirty the whole time.\nThe room is dingy and soooooo barebones. Some of the beds weren\u2019t made- they just put folded up sheets on top and expect you to do it yourself. There are no hand towels. Or tissues. Or coffee maker. Or staff in the building.\nIt\u2019s a literal free-for-all here. As we were coming back from dinner, we found a lost kid. He didn\u2019t know his room number or his parents\u2019 phone numbers, and I tried to help him find his room, to no avail- all the room numbers start with \u201c2\u201d and are 5 digits long, so it\u2019s super confusing- he didn\u2019t know what floor he was on. After we wandered the halls for a minute, I tried to take him to the front desk to discover there was no front desk, and no employees were to be found whatsoever in the whole building. So that definitely contributes to the fact that people are going wild and partying above me right now and it\u2019s 3:00 am.\nOk, so the room and its building are bad- but we came here for the water park! Y\u2019all, it\u2019s so gross. You can smell the bathrooms from like 20 feet away. It was so poorly planned- there are areas where you have to squeeze between a pillar and the lazy river- like to come up or down the only staircase into the park- it\u2019s not even wide enough for two people to fit through. And there are a million people at the park. People are everywhere. Crowding at the sparse number of tables, saving all the seats so we could only find one chair for our party of 10. Putting their stuff all over the floor because there\u2019s literally nowhere else to put it. Changing in the stinky bathroom stalls because there\u2019s not a changing room. There is ONE family room with a changing table, and I think a family was living in it when we were there. They kept sending people in and out of the room while we waited for it for about 25 minutes. We finally gave up and changed in a stinky bathroom stalls\nBut we didn\u2019t come for the bathrooms- we came for the slides! Meh. My kids went down them for about an hour and then everyone was ready to leave. Our 10 year old called it a mediocre water park, and I think she was being generous. Do not come here. It\u2019s seriously worth it to pay more for a more expensive water park. It feels so gross and dirty here.",

                "text": "We go to Tom Fooleries fairly often. Usually we have a decent time.\nHere are a few complaints and I hope by making this review, corporate will take our suggestions seriously.\nFor families who have young ones under 42inches tall, you get a $20 wrist band. They literally can only do 1 ride alone. The small rollercoaster and large Carousel , they have ti be accompanied by a paying adult which is $45. Not even an older child (we have a 12 year old) who had a $45 wrist band.\nThey also can\u2019t do go carts even as a passenger with a responsible paying adult.\nThey have mini rides but those are credits, 12 credits for the tea cups which equates to roughly a $5 game card\u2026\u2026\u2026 1 min ride, it\u2019s just mind blowing to me\nAlso the arcade, good luck finding anything under 10 credits to play. I bought a $10 game card and got 1 game out of it because it was 12 credits and the game needed two people.\n\nIt also highly bothers me that they have attractions (human claw) that require credits. As if you don\u2019t pay enough with the wrist bands as it is\u2026\u2026.the lines are long and it\u2019s not fun to wait 30 min in line to be told you can\u2019t do it, employees enforce these rules like their life depends on it, there is zero leeway.\n\nAs a parent, I don\u2019t personally want to do any of these rides, but I\u2019m forced to. They need to revamp their rules here, it\u2019s a small theme park, it\u2019s not that serious. They also need to re-evaluate how many credits these arcade games cost. It\u2019s pretty much $5 per game, which is ludicrous.\nThanks for coming to my ted talk.",

Recommend online purchase of tickets for the discount, but if you book online for the zipline, do note that you need to arrive 15-20min ahead of your booking time to make sure and get checked in and suited up.

Rob was  my favorite guide because he was the most talkative and very personable but also more professional. All 4 guides were amazing, but we got to talk to Rob the most. The Zipline is absolutley amazing. We have ridden multiple Ziplines around the world and this was by far the best. No other Zipline even comes close to this one. The views are breathtaking. The ride is fast and fun. My two teenage girls rode it and had a blast. This is a must-do item when you visit Jackson Hole Wyoming.",

We walked in for my nieces 10th birthday party last night, only to be jumping for 10 minutes before a disgusting and vile fight broke out between a ton of adults who also involved their children in the fight. This fight went on for over 15 minutes before security, any of the employees, or police stepped in! Fighting and cussing and being disgusting right in the front lobby in front of all of the staff who were blatantly ignoring them and subjecting every child there to this trauma. When my family member asked for a refund for the $500 birthday party she just paid for, the staff refused and only agreed to partially refund her her money. They made her pay for jump socks and 4 pizzas that we weren\u2019t even able to utilize and still kept over $200 of her money! Everyone who checked in at 5pm were forcibly removed from the premises, but if you had reservations at 7pm or later, you were allowed to come back and jump. My niece\u2019s entire birthday party ruined for some ghetto disgusting fighting. Even more disgusting that all the staff and security just stood there watching a huge fist fight break out in their lobby in front of all these children! You will NEVER get my money again dirty fun city. Do not send your children here they are not safe!!!",

The staff at the front told my guests that they needed to check in with the host in the party room and would get their socks at that time. Every time we would have to hunt down a host who then needed to go and find our host. They never asked what size socks the kids needed just gave them some and left the room. My guests had to go back upfront to get a different size because they gave them all small. They only provide one juice or one water per jumper. So if parents want something to drink they charge you $2.00 for a water and because we went on a weekend they charged $2.50. Their website says that the host will help with set up, service and clean up. They did not do any of that. While we were doing cake a host come in the room and took the utensil/plate/napkin hold her. I advised that we were not done and they responded with \u201cI\u2019m taking it to refill it\u201d. It was returned after we got done. While picking up the room a staff member come in and asked who to give the bill to. While we were carrying things out someone else come in and asked us if we were using the card on file to pay the bill. They then walked me to the front counter to make sure we paid.\n\nVery poor customer service. Would not recommend having a party here.",

The variety of activities is perfect for different age groups, from toddlers to older kids. My kids loved the mini roller coasters and the soft play areas, while my preteens enjoyed the more thrilling rides.\n\nWhat really stood out was how safe and kid-friendly the park is. The staff were friendly and attentive, and we always felt like our kids were in good hands. The attractions were well-maintained.\nNow I didn\u2019t find much food options at the park itself but it\u2019s in a mall so we just took a quick break, walked to the nearest restaurant and had a bite to eat there before going back.\n\nWe ended up spending the entire day there because there was just so much to explore. It\u2019s a fantastic spot for a family outing, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and stress-free day with the kids. We can\u2019t wait to go back!",

It took me 4 years to finally visit this park, and I must say I was impressed at the vastness, rides and overall experience of the park. There\u2019s a huge section for arcade games in the right corner of the entrance area.\n\nI loved the fact that there\u2019s no ticket needed to enter the park. Anyone can enter the park, watch the rides and  use the common amenities. Passes or points are required to get on rides or to access the Paw Patrol Adventure Bay obstacle course and play area.\n\nThey offer seasonal passes which are worth it in my opinion. Took my daughter on back to back days, and she had 4+ hours of fun and entertainment. There are more than 10 rides suitable for kids under 42 inches. They also have characters meet and greet. We got to see SpongeBob and Patrick.\n\nBut seasonal passes a mess. They print with the date of purchasing the pass, not the date of visit. On our subsequent visits the scanners failed to confirm our tags. Bunch of crew members gave us a hard time to get on ride. Some made us wait until they talked to the supervisor, others made it sound like they are doing us a favor. Some told us we were trying to use tags from previous days. Seemed like so many of them didn\u2019t know how the winter/seasonal pass works!!!\n\nVending machines and snack stations are super expensive at the park. A water/soda bottle is around $4, a cotton candy is $13, and bowl of dipping dot is $11. On my second day, there were issues with our seasonal pass. Scanners were not able to verify our passes due to system glitch. A lot of the associates gave us hard time at the entrance of rides. In one case the supervisor had to come and clarify our passes were good.",

                "text": "What a great place for all ages. Parking isn\u2019t bad, I usually go up to the top and it\u2019s empty. It\u2019s definitely overpriced however, that\u2019s the city for you. Cotton candy was $15 from the machine, yikes! Tickets are $10 cheaper if you buy them in advance. The lines are not that bad. I did wait 20 mins for a baby ride.  The young lady running the ride definitely didn\u2019t want to be there, to be fair what teenager really wants to be at work lol. I\u2019ll definitely be back. It\u2019s a great place to escape to with the kids or even adults.",

You do not go at your own pace, however. You must sync up with an employee and move attraction to attraction with them and a group of kids / parents. A neat concept, but you don't control your time. Plan a minimum of 2 hours. Still quite a bit is not operational since Maria, but kids had a GREAT time. Everything happens in Spanish.",
