      "text": "This is a damn ride. \n\nIronically the best ride in Busch gardens from a technical perspective is also one of the oldest, as Kumba was built in 1993. It's 144ft tall with a top speed of 60mph and features a diving loops, a zero G roll, a cobra roll, and two interlocking loops. And as if that wasn't awesome enough, another thing this great oldie but goodie has going for it is that it was built...by B&M, today's number one coaster maker in the world\n\nb&M is known for making coaster that are smooth as silk and that move like water. They flow naturally, heavily and they feel like a dream, even when they are as fierce as Kumba, trying its very best to tear your senses out of your body. \n\nThis is, 20 years later, still, in my opinion the best full on sensory overload at Busch Gardens. \n\n5 out of 5 stars for Kumba",

LOVE love love this coaster and one of my happiest memories of high school was coming to BG with my physics class.  Kumba was still pretty new and BG provided us all sort of data to allow students to take time measurements and calculate speeds, car weights, etc.  We also had some awesome \"hands on\" activities asking us to try and lift our feet, etc. at various points during the ride and then explain the physical forces at work.  I still think Kumba has one of the best track designs/layouts of any coaster and the \"thrills\" are perfectly paced to really make you feel it!",

      "text": "Kumba is the Old Man of the roller coasters at Busch Gardens, since this steel roller coaster was first opened in 1993. At the time this was the tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster in Florida, but of course those records have since been bestowed upon other coasters long after Kumba was up and running.\n\nEven though this is a steel roller coaster with a \"smooth\" track, I still find this ride to be jarring, and it does have a bad habit of making people nauseous. I've watched people with motion sickness totally lose the contents of their stomach on this ride, and the BG crew seems to be constantly cleaning up \"biological spills\" after Barfing Bertha crawls off this ride on her hands and knees.\n\nThe name Kumba supposedly derives from the translation of the word \"Roar\" in an African dialect, but I prefer to think that it's more closely derived from the word \"Barf\"..... (see above).\n\nKumba begins with a right-hand, 90-degree turn out of the station which leads into a 143-foot-tall chain lift hill. From there you drop off to the left and then launch into a vertical loop around the lift hill. You'll go through a total of 7 inversions including interlocking corkscrews and a zero gravity roll that leaves many people's stomachs wayyyyyyyyy behind. The coaster zips along at 60 mph for just shy of three minutes, and you'll pull 3.8 G's on this ride.\n\nIt's not my favorite ride in the park, as the coaster tends to slam you back and forth against your padded headrest, and the loops and twist can be very disorienting and bang you around in your seat. Try this ride at night for a very different experience!",

(It was basically a walk-on, like all the coasters at Busch Gardens on the day we went.) The first time I came off pretty dizzy, which doesn't usually happen to me on coasters, even those with 7 inversions. I seemed to have acquired a tolerance after that, as I didn't get nearly the case of the head spins on my next 2 trips. The third time my father joined me, a cause of some concern for me and a lot for my mother. I recommended to him holding his head slightly forward to avoid headbanging. He held it way forward with his eyes closed the whole ride! He made it through all right, though he complained of the same dizziness I experienced. \n   The third loop on Kumba is a doozy. All in all I loved Kumba, though it rides a bit too rough for my taste, just enough to keep it out of 5 star range. It's the most intense and the roughest Bolliger and Mabillard coaster I've ever ridden, easily. I guess it's like an early album from some indie rock band that sold out to do nice, clean, polished commercial work. Rough around the edges, but rocking out with exurberance.",

There were a couple of firsts on this trip...some of which I would like to share.\n\n1) This was the first time I heard Bone Thugz & Harmony's hit song Crossroads. My buddy AJ had a discman CD player (don't try to age me) with him and he let me take a listen. Became one of my favorite songs.\n\n2) This was the first overnight school field trip that I ever took - and the only one that didn't include me and my buddies plotting how to sneak in booze (it was a simpler time in elementary school - though high school was a lot more fun haha). \n\n3) This was the first time I ever rode Kumba. And the second, third, fourth and possibly fifth - if memory serves me correctly.\n\nKumba will always hold a special place in my heart. Even riding it in recent years I get flashbacks to this field trip and while it's often overlooked by the brand new, shiny rides that have been added since 1995 - it still holds it's own!\n\nIt is nearly 3 minutes long - has 7 inversions - top speed of 60 MPH and the color combination of the track is one of the best you will see. That aqua and yellow (with some red) is iconic at this point.\n\nA quick search turns up that even though it's pretty old as far as coasters go - it's still consistently ranked in the Top 50 (most recently #33) on roller coaster rankings. You've done well old friend. I hope they never decommission you - cause if they do...I guess I'll meet you at the crossroads..............",

      "text": "We're here at Busch Gardens Tampa reviewing one of the most legendary and iconic coasters ever built. You know, THAT coaster that everyone raves about with the two corkscrews at the end? Yeah! That's Kumba. And this coaster is really freaking good. Plus, it's the first large scale B&M ever built! So this a very historic ride, as well as it, paved the way for many other outstanding B&M loopers such as Riddler's Revenge, Montu, and Hulk! So let's review this coaster.\n\nWe get in our old-school B&M sitdown trains and pull down the lap bar. We then head up the lift hill which not only gives us some great views of the park, but we also get to go through the first loop! So that's pretty sweet. We then head down the first drop which gives us some great speed. We then hit the vertical loop. And if you've ridden Riddler's Revenge, it's pretty much the same inversion except your sitting and not standing (which is why I slightly prefer Riddler's loop to this as Stand-Up Hangtime is just so awesome). We then hit a dive loop which is going so fast that you don't even have a moment to process it. We then hit the best part of the ride, the heartline spin. Now, if you're a coaster enthusiast, you've probably seen people RAVE about this element like it's the greatest thing ever. And it's an outstanding element, don't get me wrong. It's very powerful indeed and is so good that you just fly through it. However, I do actually prefer the heartline roll on Hulk (as that one LAUNCHES you into the thing) and Montu (which tries to kill you with forces). So in a way, I actually think this element is somewhat overhyped. Regardless of that though, the heartline spin is still pretty crazy. Easily a top 3 heartline spin. Just not the absolute best element ever like some people rave. We then hit the cobra roll which is SUPER intense, easily my 2nd favorite cobra roll. It's funny though because Scream and Kraken have similar cobra rolls, yet their cobra rolls are trash. Did B&M just forget how to make cobra rolls good after they made this and Hulk?\n\nWe then hit the MCBR which surprisingly doesn't take away too much of our speed. But unfortunately, we hit my absolute least favorite part of the ride, the corkscrews. While these weren't forceless, I did bang my head on them on 2 of my rides. And yeah, it hurt. It hurt a lot. I actually got a migraine from this, and I'm willing to call this the most painful B&M that I've ridden. Now, Kumba is almost 30 years old so I can forgive it for being rough, but it's still shocking that Kumba is rough yet Montu is smooth as glass. And it isn't just these elements, there is a rattle on a good chunk of the ride's transitions as well. But anyways, after the corkscrews, we then hit a small hill which actually gives a little pop of airtime before hitting the final helix of the ride. And this part is GOOD. Like good lord, this section is just so freaking fast. We're just tearing through it. After that amazing element, we then hit the brake run.\n\nI've said this to my friends, but I am being genuine. Kumba is so close to being a perfect ride. If BGT can put some TLC into it or re-track it, this could be my favorite or 2nd favorite coaster of all time. Despite that, Kumba is still pretty outstanding. While it's not my absolute favorite B&M or my favorite ride in the park, it's pretty darn close to it as it still ranks among the best coasters I've ever ridden. Seriously, it's up there with rides like Hagrid's, Incredible Hulk, X2, GhostRider Twisted Colossus, and Montu in the same park which is also some of the best coasters I've ridden. Between this Montu and soon to be Iron Gwazi, BGT really does have an outstanding coaster lineup. I highly recommend riding Kumba! You will not be disappointed (unless you get a migraine)\n\nFinal Score: 98/100\n\nOpened: April 20, 1993\n\nManufacturer: B&M\n\nLast Ridden: January 12, 2020\n\n5th Best Rollercoaster That I have Ridden",

      "text": "Here we go folks, number four on my list of favorite rides here at Busch Gardens is Kumba! This is what I would consider the perfect \"normal\" roller coaster. No gimmicks, just a fun, fast steel coaster with a smooth ride and tons of excitement. At 143ft tall with a top speed of 60mph, it sits in a perfect sweet spot of exciting enough for the coaster addicts, but not so scary that the family would shy away from riding. There are several inversions throughout, but most are big sweeping corkscrews, with only one true loop. The way every turn goes into the next is so well designed and every single motion is smooth as glass. I didn't feel uncomfortably shaken at all during my ride, something certain big coasters can do. I didn't believe it when i looked it up but this is a 25 year old coaster! I does not show its age at all. I had never been to this park before so I kind of assumed it was a new addition. Kumba is hidden over in the Congo area of the park, but its worth a little exploration as it is a must ride on your visit.",

Falcon's Fury is intense! It's a 5 star attraction for sure. My one quibble would be that Power Tower, though much shorter, seems to drop you faster. That might just be me being a Cedar Point fanboy though. I really wish I had ridden this more than once, but with the early 5pm closing and it's location smack dab in the middle of this mammoth park it just wasn't doable for one last plunge.",

This is by no means a slight tilt, you are facing the ground ataight on! I don't know how tall this tower is, but it's billed as the tallest in Florida, so you are HIGH!

      "text": "Falcon's Fury is Busch Gardens newest attraction for those of us who love the rush of adrenaline much more than we love good old-fashioned common sense. The ride is officially described as a free-standing Sky Jump drop tower attraction which lifts you and 31 of your dearest friends to a height of 335 feet above the park, giving you a spectacular view of Tampa (assuming that you keep your eyes open).\n\nI had the chance to ride Falcon's Fury during it's soft opening, and enjoyed it so much that I got right back in line to ride it a second time that afternoon. This time, it was a night, during our Yelp-O-Scream event, and it was a whole different experience.\n\nYou're seated 8 riders to a side, in a square lift mechanism that slowly hikes you up and up and up as you climb to a height of 335 feet. On cue your seat tips forward, till you are facing straight down, and it feels like only the horse collar is holding you in place. By now the screaming has reached a feverous pitch, and then there is that agonizing wait before \"the drop\".\n\nYou hear the click as the electric brakes are unlocked, and suddenly you are free-falling towards earth at about 60 mph. You're pulling 3.5 G's for a 310 foot free-fall before your seat tips back up to upright, and you are slowly lowered back the remaining 25 feet to the ground. The entire ride lasts about 2 minutes, and several people kept up an ear-splitting shriek of terror for the entire time.\n\nOnce you're back on the ground you're usually laughing hysterically while gasping for breath, and then running back around to get in line for a second time.\n\nDuring the day, the views of Tampa are spectacular and the rush of the ground coming up to meet your face is absolutely terrifying the first time that you ride this attraction. At night, you're able to focus on the lights of the park and the City of Tampa, and the crazy blend of colors and lights on the drop tower really enhances the sensation of falling.\n\nI've now ridden Falcon's Fury four times -- twice during the day, and twice at night. I really love this attraction, and just need to find more screwballs like me who enjoy these types of rides. \n\nWell done Busch Gardens!!!!",

      "text": "I LOVE THIS RIDE. I was super excited to try this ride out on my first visit back to Busch Gardens after several years. Unfortunately for me, both of my brothers and my mother were too afraid to give it a go. I had to wait until my second visit back with my boyfriend. I wasn't scared of going on Falcon's Fury... well not that scared anyway, but Sam was terrified. I basically forced him to go on it as he said he wasn't ready yet (he wanted to ride Sheikra first and then work his way up to Falcon's Fury). I didn't feel like walking across the park to Sheikra so I basically pushed him into the line at Falcon's Fury.\n\nThe wait to get on the ride is probably the scariest part. You see rider after rider take their seat with great fear in their eyes, and then you see them return safely to the ground taking deep breaths and laughing nervously. I even saw a grown man clutch his friend's arm and tell him \"Never again!\"\n\nOnce seated on the ride you get all strapped in, and I mean strapped in! They make it super tight so there is very little wiggle room at all. Safety first!  You then are elevated to the top of the ride at a slowish speed. Once you reach the top they slowly swing the seats back so that you are facing the ground. All of the people walking around Busch Gardens look like ants! Then finally, a few seconds later, they drop you! And just before you think you're about to hit the ground- splat!, they swing the seats back up to the upright position and you are safely on the ground.\n\nUnlike the grown man I mentioned earlier, when I got off my first ride I was yelling wilth joy- \"That was AWESOME!!!\" I couldn't wait to do it again!\n\nSince then I have been on Falcon's Fury 4 or 5 times and I still love it!!",

You're going to have to remove everything that isn't attached well (glasses, hats, cell phones.)\n\nAt the top, they tip the chairs so that you are hanging against your restraints and you truly feel like you're going to fall out.  Once released, the free-fall is amazing and the landing controlled and not jerky at all.\n\nGreat bucket list accomplishment if you're afraid of heights :)",

My daughter however chose to ride this past weekend when we visited the park. The wait time wasn't long and the staff they have working the ride is very attentive to the needs of guests and ensures their safety. They check the height of young riders before they can even enter the line and are very organized with positioning riders in the waiting areas prior to getting on the ride. My daughters friend got in a panic after boarding the ride, she raised her hands and called the staff over letting them know she didn't want to ride any longer. They immediately halted things and unlocked her, escorting her off the ride. \n\nI felt with the level of attention and coordination of the staff that the girls were safe. There is plenty of areas around the ride where you can view riders and take pictures.",

In 2014 when the ride was being built, there were many delays, but SO worth it.\n\nThe line isn't usually too long. Since 32 people can ride at once, and the cycle is short, wait usually doesn't exceed 20 minutes. The ride ops tell you where to sit (based on diamonds) so it makes it very efficient. \n\nYou're strapped in tight and go up 335 feet. The view is great, especially facing Tampa and the Hillsborough River. It's especially terrifying realizing you're taller than Sheikra! At the top, the seats tilt and all of your weight slides to your harness. Terrifying. You can be held at the top for one to five seconds.\n\nThe mechanism releases and you fall straight down. There is so much wind and the fall feels like an eternity, but it's so liberating, just falling like that. It feels much different than riding Sheikra. This is a little less scary, honestly, but way better.\n\nYou will love this ride. When people \"return\" they're always smiling and laughing. Just face your fears and ride!",

      "text": "Oh man, this ride is something else. A fairly imposing drop tower, Falcon's Fury is the tallest ride in the park at 335ft. I've been on towers that drop you before, and I've been on towers that launch you skyward before, but this is the only ride I've been on that simulates you plummeting towards the ground FACE FIRST. Approximately 3/4 of the way up the ascent your seat begins to tilt inward until you are parallel to the ground essentially hanging from your shoulder harness. Right about the time your brain starts to say \"I shouldn't be in this position\" you hear a click and begin to fall straight down (again, face first) at 60mph. Right before you think your going to hit concrete (about 80% down) your seat flips back out into its upright position with a woosh and you slowly come back to earth. Drop towers don't normally bother me but that change in orientation kind of freaks you out a bit. Not a ride for the faint of heart.",

You can try to calm yourself down by talking to the person next to you about how pretty Tampa looks from all the way up there, but it's probably not going to work. I can tell you that from experience. \n\nThat being said, once the clicking stops and you know what's coming next, you might as well take a deep breath and wait for the really fun part to come... The drop. Within seconds, you're back on the ground, unsure of how you're feeling but left with a strange desire to do it all again. \n\nI've been on rides like this before, the go high in the air and drop super fast type, but never facing directly down. This experience made for even more butterflies in my tummy. What's so great about this ride that makes you not weary to do again and again? It's comfy! No need to worry about the harness sticking into you in weird places, your head rattling from left to right over and over, or jerking motions pulling you up and down the whole time. It's smoooooooth. \n\nI'm not one that's afraid of rollercoasters but would even encourage friends with the deepest fear of rides like this to give it a shot. It's definitely one of my favorite attractions at this park, if not many.\n\nIf only you could linger at the top a little bit longer. At night, the lights of Tampa make for quite the sight...",

Not sure why, but not complaining!\n\nYou start by sitting in your car that hangs under the track. The floor drops away, and you start going up the 150 foot tall hill. You get an amazing view...of the parking lot. But if you're on the right side of the train you do get to see the tangled metal that is waiting for you ;)\n\nThe drop is so fun! It's not the scariest, but its such a weird feeling to be seeing sky under your feet. You zoom through a loop, then into an underground tunnel to emerge into an Immelman loop. You swoop close to the ground before going back up and twisting in a fun corkscrew.\n\nThe next part of the ride is my least favorite. You plunge into a tight loop configuration called a batwing, which involves two loops and going into a little ditch. The loops are fine, but the g-forces in the pit are too intense for me. I pulled a muscle in my back once (somehow) on that part, so I'm always nervous.\n\nYou pull into a short break run before beginning a super fun part of the ride. You dive into a tunnel and do a quick loop before starting a quick and nimble run around the \"excavation\" ditches. It's just so fun going up, down, underground, and back up again. One last surprise and fast corkscrew and you pull into the station again. Whew!\n\nThis ride is fun, if a little too forceful in some parts (batwing) and not enough in others (first three loops of the ride). I feel like this ride breaks down more often than Kumba or Sheikra do (nothing tops Cheetah Hunt, though). However, there is rarley a line, and it's a really smooth ride. \n\nOverall, this is a nice part of the Busch Gardens lineup. Although not perfect, it s still awesome!",

I'll take it over Cedar Point's Raptor any day. It rides smoother, has a much less claustrophobic layout and the batwing element that sends you barreling through a tunnel is a blast. \n   The Egyptian theming in the queue is pretty sweet, too, though Busch Gardens can't really touch sister park Sea World in that department. \n   Montu is a fun ride, but not the kind of thing I want to ride all day.

I haven't done the research but I am pretty sure that this coaster has the most inversions than any other coasters at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay.

I have been on this ride so many times and not once have I waited more than 10 minutes to ride it. There are cubbies for your shoes and small belongings (sunglasses, hats, tiny purses) in which you may not need a locker to purchase. This coaster is located very close to the park entrance next to the newly opened Cobra's Curse. Honestly, skip that ride and hit Montu. It's an amazing ride",

Four riders per car usually moves the line along quickly.\n\nThe ride is fast, fun and seems to last long enough that you really feel like you get your money's worth for the wait. The track is smooth, no jerking, or side to side slam of your head on the harness. Luckily today the lines were short and I was able to get three in quickly.\n\nI also found out if you have a Platinum pass you can ask to ride another time and not get out of your seat... now that is a really big perk if you waited in line for a long time.\n\nOn the down side this coaster is more up front of the park and can get mobbed, so hit is up early.

Suspended coasters really do the best job of making you feel like you're flying and Montu is no exception. Coming out of a loop and into a tunnel at 60+ MPH is always a thrill, it reminds me of the Afterburner back home at Carowinds. My only minor complaint about this one is simply related to the nature of the ride. The speed and angles that give this ride such a big thrill are a little harsh in a couple of the turns, and while that doesn't mean it isn't a wonderful ride, you might not want to ride multiple times in quick succession.",

As Montu sits at the very edge of the park, my family and I always make a game of spotting the car over in the lot across the street (trust me, my car is easy to spot).  Montu is an inverted coaster where your feet dangle and the track is above your head. There is just a special kind of magic about seeing the clouds fly by beneath your feet as you go through some of the loops.  I love the decor and theming of the area around Montu - all ancient Egypt and hieroglyphs.",

      "text": "Fun fact for those who missed it: back in the day, there used to be baby alligators at the very beginning of the ride, just where the gate opens! You would dip down and slightly panic as you imagined getting your toes a little too close to the modern day dinos. I'm sure they were removed for their own health and well-being, but I do miss them whenever I ride Montu. :)\n\nAn oldie but a goodie, Montu is a staple at Busch Gardens. When it opened in '96, it was the tallest and fastest of its kind! While drastic improvements have been made to roller coasters since then, Montu still provides a thrilling ride. My favorite maneuver will always be the tight corkscrew. So much fun!\n\nIt's not the smoothest coaster at BG, but I do find it a little smoother than Kumba, BG's first roller coaster. That being said, Montu manages to make me dizzy every time I ride it, while Kumba does not! The latter is just a little rougher of a ride.\n\nI was a little disappointed when I noticed there's no longer a photo op after the drop. Not sure what the reason would be for this. I have fond memories of looking at my cheeks fluttering in the wind in the pictures after the ride!\n\nIf you love inversion coasters, definitely check out Montu!",

      "text": "Montu was a falcon-god of war in the ancient Egyptian religion, and Busch Gardens took the legend of this mythical God of flight, and turned it into a swooping, swirling, and incredibly fast steel roller coaster. Montu opened in 1996, and at the time it was the tallest and fastest inverted roller coaster in the world.\n\nYou start by walking through a section of the park just beyond the Crown Colony Restaurant. Tucked back in the corner is this area that looks like an archeological dig in the sands of Egypt. Passing though an archway, and you've discovered the temple of Montu. When the ride was first launched, a Nile crocodile exhibit was located underneath the first section of the ride. These animals were later relocated to the park's main animal habitat.\n\nYou wind around inside the pyramid before being loaded 4-across onto your cars. Once everyone is locked into place the floor drops away, leaving your feet to dangle freely. The cars swoop out of the station and then you begin the long chain lift climb up the first hill.\n\nWithout hesitation you swoop down towards the ground and into a large vertical loop, before you're whisked back up, and go through a series of inversions, twist and turns. The specs for this ride say that you'll go through 7 inversions, including two vertical loops. You'll reach top speeds of 60 mph with 3.8 G's and LOTS of airtime. The ride lasts about 3 minutes, and it is one of my very favorite rides in the park.\n\nI can, and have, ridden Montu several times in a row, and never grow tired of the excitement. This ride is fast, smooth, and extremely exhilarating.\n\nAnother Busch Gardens special attraction that should not be missed!",

You're barely out of that loop when you're bombarded with a series of horizontal rolls and loops.\n\nThe ride is a longer coaster experience and your senses are engaged almost completely the entire time.

Not those rinky dink coasters at the Dade County Youth Fair - I'd never ride those - but I'd ride almost every coaster at major theme parks.\n\nWith a fair share of rides under my belt Montu continues to be one of my favorites. I've always had a weird obsession with Egypt (and Dinosaurs?!) and this is located in the Egypt section of the part -so perhaps that has something to do with how much I love this ride....but it really is a great coaster!\n\nFeet dangling. 7 inversions. 3 minutes long. 150 feet tall. Speeds up to 60 mph......and that color scheme is pretty sick (beige and purple). I don't know why but I really get a kick out of awesome color schemes on coasters.\n\nThis is a must do front row. I've come to BG a few times now and every time I have done this one front row.\n\n2003 - Came on a field trip - me and my buddy rode it 3 times straight: front row!\n\n2008 - Came with my wife and managed to get her to ride it. She loved it - mainly because it was a lot smoother than the one we went on before this (Gwazi...yikes!). Front row!\n\n2014 - Came with a big group and rode front row with a couple of buddies (Yelp event) - it was night time and pretty awesome....oh yea, FRONT ROW!\n\nIt's hard to believe this coaster is almost 20 years old! It's withstood the test of time and a must do coaster at BGTB!\n\nFUN FACT: Montu is one of only seven roller coasters to appear in the top 50 for all 15 years in Amusement Today\u200a'\u200bs annual Golden Ticket Awards!",

      "text": "We're here at Busch Gardens Tampa getting ready to ride. Montu, their legendary B&M inverted coaster.\n\nNow, if you look at this ride from the ground. It looks amazing. I mean, it's very pretty, the inversions look great, it's well themed, it looks great. However, this ride is not good. No, no no no. IT'S FREAKING AMAZING! LIKE OH MY GOD, THIS RIDE IS ACTUALLY FREAKING INSANE. This ride blows literally every other B&M invert that I've ridden out of the water. It makes Batman and Dragon Challenge look like SILVER BULLET! It's THAT GOOD! So yeah, this ride is flipping amazing. Now let's get into why this coaster is as godlike as it is.\n\nWe first exit the station and head into the lift hill. Apparently, there used to be an alligator pit below the pre-life section. But this was removed for unknown reasons (my guess was due to stupid GP people thinking it was funny to throw stuff at them (OMG SERIOUSLY I HATE PEOPLE)). But anyway, we then head up the big lift hill and get a nice view of the big twisted mess off to the left and Tampa itself off to the right. After this, we hit the first drop, while it's not Twisted Colossus or X2 good, it's FAST and gives a nice whip to it. We then soar into the vertical loop. And unlike most, this one is FAST. We just fly through this thing with some awesome forces. Don't worry, the worst part of the ride is over. (Yes I said the worst part, the terror of Montu has only begun). We then head into a dark trench with a ton of speed until suddenly *BOOM* we shoot out of it through an Immelmann. Not only is this moment insane on its own due to the crazy speed and forces we get, but we get a CRAZY foot chopper moment since the entrance to Egypt is mere inches away from us. So yeah, that moment was awesome. We then hit a zero g roll which is insane as this thing is POWERFUL. Seriously, what's with the Florida B&M's and having powerful Zero G Rolls. It's like they all formed a blood pack or something. So yeah, this moment is crazy. However, the madness is not quite over as we then get into one of the most intense moments on any coaster out there. The Batwing. DEAR.... FREAKING.... LORD.... They put a batwing in the middle of a trench which sounds insane already. But the fact that you have almost ALL OF YOUR FREAKING SPEED FROM THE ZERO G ROLL INTO IT CREATES SOME OF THE STRONGEST FORCES EVER. LIKE DEAR GOD. THIS IS JUST INSANE. THIS IS LITERALLY X2 INSANE RIGHT HERE. We then get a small breather by gliding into the MCBR (which doesn't take away much if not any of our speed) as the then head into the 2nd half of the ride. If you're worried that you're gonna lose your speed here, don't worry. Montu's not one of those coasters that dies after the 2nd half (I'm looking at YOU Mako). In fact, this is still probably as intense as your average Batman clone (Which is still one of the more intense B&M's ever). But anyway, we then hit another vertical loop. This is even better than the first as it's smaller so we are still flying through it. After that, we then hit a fairly strong helix before hitting a corkscrew (which is pretty dang strong as well and is made even better since it's in a trench). We then hit the brake run, and out of breath.\n\nHave I mentioned I love this ride? Yes? Well let me say it again, I FREAKING LOVE MONTU. THIS COASTER IS SO FREAKING NUTS! This is unquestionably the best coaster in Florida (well at least it is until Iron Gwazi Opens) and it's easily the best coaster I have ever ridden (out of the 90 that I've ridden). Montu is THAT insane. On top of everything that I mentioned, this is also the smoothest B&M I have ever ridden. There is NO RATTLE ON THIS THING AT ALL, ON TOP OF NO HEADBANGING. IT'S SO SMOOTH. Anyways, I cannot recommend Montu enough. Ride Montu. I don't care if the line is somehow absurdly long or if the apocalypse is about to happen. RIDE MONTU. YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T\n\nFinal Score: 100/100\n\nOpened: May 16, 1996\n\nManufacturer: B&M\n\nLast Ridden: January 12, 2020\n\nBest Rollercoaster that I have ever ridden",

Since you are dangling from the top visually its a better ride in the front and due to the nature of the ride itself, riding in the front provides very unique ride feeling almost as if you are motionless during some moments.  In the back, it will feel much faster as you get whipped around.  Try it from both and see what you think.",

      "text": "A really fun coaster, but about as big of a disappointment as a four star review can be. I know, I know, I'm a fool for having such sky high expectations, and it's totally first world problems. Cheetah Hunt rides nice and smooth but just doesn't pack anywhere near the visceral punch of that Intamin launched masterpiece up in Sandusky, Maverick. \n   I had watched a YouTube pov of this coaster so I knew Cheetah Hunt doesn't put it's elements in rapid fire succession like Maverick, as it's trying to mimic a cheetah rocketing across the savannah rather than a wild bucking horse. But I also knew the YouTube video of Maverick doesn't come anywhere close to capturing the exurberant thrill of actually strapping in and riding it. So I thought Cheetah Hunt would hold similar uncapturable wonder. And it was really good, but not 5 star great. And this might be splitting hairs, but cheetahs can reach speeds of 65 MPH while this high tech piece of humankind's machinery only hits 60. Couldn't you have boosted these cheetah-themed trains another 5 MPH, guys? \n   Cheetah Hunt also has the hard restraints that Cedar Point wisely swapped out for a softer variety on Maverick. And they're not as bad as some of the CP fanboys have made them out to be but the soft restraints are clearly superior, especially if wait times are short and you want to reride again and again without accruing a sore pair of shoulder blades. As for me, I squeezed in 2 rides on Cheetah Hunt on a February Wednesday when Busch Gardens closed at the early hour of 5pm.\n   Cheetah Hunt is a fine roller coaster, but just isn't in the same league as Maverick, or even Sheikra which sits elsewhere in the same park. If your time is limited and you have to choose just one to ride or reride I recommend Sheikra.",

The only problem is they hold back pretty hardcore because its designed as a starter coaster, meaning its mainly for early aged teenies. It's got three launches, and all of them are awesome. It's also got some really cool elements that I've actually never seen on a coaster before simply by the nature of the ride being designed to simulate a cheetah running through the Forrest and stalking its prey. \n\nThe only problem that I have with the ride is that it's about 13 mph too slow. Notch this bad boy up 13mph, and it would easily go from 4 out of 5 to a very easy 5 out of 5 stars\n\nI give cheetah run a swift 4 out of 5 stars",

The ride will sprint down over 4,000 feet of track across a Serengeti plain and through a canyon.  It will open with a sister attraction called Cheetah Run, which will feature close-up encounters with Earth's fastest animal.\n\nBusch Gardens says that Cheetah Hunt will have the largest footprint of any attraction yet built at their park.\n\nEven though it is tough not to get excited about another roller coaster in the Central Florida market with the design style of Disney's Rock 'n' Roller Coaster and Universal's the Mummy, not everyone is excited about the name.  In fact, many fans believe that the name suggests that guests are hunting the cheetahs, which obviously goes against the park's conservation efforts.\n\nNevertheless, I plan on riding it once, then again, and then several more times.",

The emphasis is on smooth forward quick motion rather than the ups and downs the traditional coaster. Travels about three quarters of length of the park over a very short period of time, and it one point actually goes over the sky ride. Smoooooth and comfortable. If you're afraid of coasters, don't let the first tower scare you away, cause after the figure eight, that's the only real drop, the rest is fairly close to (and sometimes below) the ground.

BuschGardens has a wooden roller coaster that just makes you so nauseated by the time you're done and then you get on this roller coaster and it's like night and day difference.\n\nThe technology that went behind this roller coaster to make it launch and accelerate you like it does is very cool.  There are two different types of motors that can be used for the launch process one is a linear induction and the second is linear synchronous motor.  Now the motors can be powered either pneumatically or hydraulically I believe this ride is actually pneumatic just from listening to the pressure release when you're launching.\n\nI have ridden this ride enough to notice that if you sit in the front it seems to go a lot faster to sit in the back it doesn't seem to go as fast but the big humps you go over deliver a lot of airtime.\n\nThe only complaint I have is there aren't enough inversions I mean loops upside down the cool stuff!

If you are afraid of coasters, just try this one and you will be pleasantly surprised at how thrilling it is, but not terrifying or scary. This is pure fun.

      "text": "TLDR: Although the wait times can be long, they are well worth it for the best roller coaster at Busch Gardens.\n\nWith the gradual addition and removal of rides at Busch Gardens over the years, I think Busch Gardens has a real gem in Cheetah Hunt. As noted by the name, this is a more unique type of roller coaster that starts off with an almost instantaneous launch instead of your traditional big drop. There's a variety of twists and turns throughout the ride and it makes for a great experience in a roller coaster that makes you want to ride again as soon as it's over.\n\nWith the lines sometimes getting a bit outrageous here, I would highly recommend getting the fast lane pass for this ride. From my understanding, if you don't use the pass for the other rides listed, you can use the pass again for a second on Cheetah Hunt. It's a really great way to save 30-60 minutes and experience the roller coaster more than once. \n\nIf you don't mind waiting a bit more, there is a separate line for the first row. I didn't get a chance to ride in the first row, but you do have a great experience either way on any part of the ride.",

      "text": "I cannot believe that I haven't reviewed my favorite coaster at Busch Gardens yet.  I have a paralyzing fear of heights but Cheetah Hunt doesn't trigger me at all. This is a launch coaster so there's no agonizing slow climb up a lift hill where you go higher and higher.  You just go flying around a nearby corner as you are launched.  What's really fun is that there is a second launch that gets you going 60 mph as you are propelled up into a really unique looking part of the track that wraps around itself.  This is the part you see in the Busch Gardens logo! After this part there's one last launch and some fun sections where you can get some airtime. On some of the other coasters such as Montu your view isn't so great if you're not in the front, but I think sitting in any part of Cheetah Hunt is fine. Another nice feature is that instead of the huge horse collars you have to wear for other coasters the overhead restrains are smaller and more comfortable because there's only one inversion on the track. I love this coaster!",

      "text": "One of my very favorite roller coasters across the country, Cheetah Hunt simulates the explosive speed of a cheetah on the run hunting for a meal. The ride starts with you strapping yourself into high-tech seat with a pull-down shoulder restraint that locks you in place into your seat. After a quick thumbs up from the ride attendants you burst ahead with a blast of speed and then start the looping and twisting motions as the cheetah dodges and weaves around the park.\n\nYou soar up to look out over the entire park, and then suddenly blast down as if the animal is chasing it's prey. Along the way coaster aficionados will get plenty of air time as you crest the heights and then chase after your stomach as the track drops away for a steep dive.\n\nBe sure to stop and watch the Park's cheetahs at the exhibit near the entrance to this ride, and pay attention to how they seem to zoom back and forth as they run. That's what this ride will feel like!",

There are so many different ride elements on this coaster that make it unique.  The next time I go, I definitely want to ride it during the day to take in the amazing views.

I lost like 100lbs to be able to ride a rollercoaster and I was stoked to be able to ride, but that all changed when I went on Cheetah. I was shook. It was over. \n\nEnter 2019 and several baby coasters later (thanks scorpion, my old friend!) Anyhow. A glass of wine, 50 Baby Shamu rides at Sea world and a few Scorpion warm up rides and my coaster balls were once again a force to be reckoned with. Awww yeah. I was ready. Okay this was like four days ago. I rode it twice on Sunday and I'm good to go. It's a top 3 favorite. 1) Baby Shamu at the SeaWorld Orlando kiddy park - do not judge me! 2). Old trusty Scorpion, 3). Cheetah. 4) Manta at SeaWorld, and that one is scary af to me, but I'm still a coaster newb. If you want an exhilarating ride, do cheetah hunt. It's AMAZING. \n\nMore to come later this week. I plan on tackling Kumba and Sand Serpent. I know that's a kiddie ride but let me do me.",

My absolute favorite part of the ride experience is when the track snakes back and forth as if you are a cheetah bobbing and weaving on the hunt! You can see it about 39 seconds into this video link of the ride, but experiencing it is so much better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skez9_TTJb4  \nor at the 1 minute : 26 second mark on this ride experience video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwDDIACHwg4\n\nThe ride takes off in a 40 mph burst of speed from the very moment you begin, then into a curve and down underground. It's so smooth it's ridiculous!  I hate those sorts of coasters that are so bumpy and jerky that I feel like I have a headache after riding them. Cheetah Hunt delivers all the thrills without any of the headaches! It is truly a fantastic coaster and has similar elements from Cedar Points amazing Maverick coaster (one of my all-time favorites).\n\nBut what makes this ride even more awesome is the 48\" height requirement. There are very few rides that have this sort of speed and thrill that younger children can ride. It makes it very easy for a mom or dad to take their younger children on the same ride experience with the older kids! THAT is awesome!  \n\n\n\nRIDE FACTS\n\nMax speed: 60 mph\nDuration: 4 minutes\nTrack length: 4,429\u2032\nHeight: 102\u2032\n\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nAWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME... and to quote Forrest Gump: \"That's all I have to say about that!\"\n\n\n\n2016/53",

But its for good reason. \n\nThe ride starts out with a pretty fast and powerful launch, quickly followed by a faster one. You rise to the top of a tower. You have a few seconds to admire the view before you plunge into a pit!\n\nThe rest of the ride soars over the Serengeti Plain. If you aren't screaming, you can admire the view of the park. I love the part where you zig zag over a river, dodging rocks and waterfalls. \n\nThat's followed by a THIRD launch, pushing you over an awesome airtime hill before bringing you back to home. \n\nThis ride is just amazing. Be sure to either ride it super early or super late if you don't want to wait in line. Awesome at night :)",

I mean I have some long standing favorites (spoiler alert: Gwazi is not one of them!) but this new coaster is smooth, fast and pretty awesome.\n\nSo I quickly learned that 60 miles per hour is pretty freakin' fast. Apparently it feels especially fast if you are doing front row! Yep, me and 2 of my buddies (and one random dude) all rode front row - you know, YOLO. We got launched off the platform (awesome!) and whizzed through the track for what felt like forever. I read that the ride lasts 3 and a half minutes. I promise it feels extremely long....and every second is worth it. The ride climbs to about 130 feet (then drops you down) and there's one inversion. \n\nThis is a great addition to Busch Gardens and if you haven't been in a few years they have a couple cool rides that you might want to come check out - this being one of them.\n\nWhile I didn't see it, I read there is also a cheetah exhibit near the ride to tie in with the theme of it. You get to watch as the cheetahs sprint after toys, showcasing their insane speed.",

Just like the Hulk at Universal, it starts with a launch (a boost) that jettisons you out of the loading bay at 30mph. There is then a second launch that shoots you up to the coaster's top speed of 60mph. A third launch toward the end boosts you back up to 40mph before the final brake run and end of the ride.\n\nThe ride is thrilling and so much fun. I absolutely love it! You can really tell that the engineers researched how cheetahs actually move and hunt in the wild. If you haven't watched any cheetah documentaries, cheetahs are known for quickly switching directions and using their tails for balance, flicking them from side to side as they move. You can literally feel this sensation during the ride, and it's wonderfully immersive.\n\nIf you love roller coasters, don't pass this one up.

It's a like you're inside a giant temple, and the huge stone cheetah in the center really adds to the epic scale of things. Lines were not that bad, though to be fair I don't think mid December is peak theme park season, even in Florida. \n\nEach train can hold sixteen thrill seekers per run, lined up two by two. Over the shoulder restraints keep you nice and snug, but the seats are still comfortable. Any seat is a good one on this ride but if you have the time do yourself a favor and ride front row at least once. Maybe it's childish, but being up with the custom designed cheetah head on the front of the train makes the ride seem just that much more fun. \n\nOnce your locked in it's time for an incredible roller coaster experience. Less than ten seconds into pulling away from the station the first set of electromagnetic launch motors shoots you into a sweeping left turn at 30mph and into a dip. The curve straightens out and just as you think you might slow down you hit the second launch, the largest and fastest of the ride. You rocket onward and upward 100ft into the air at 60mph and once you crest the hill you ease into a figure eight with a wonderful view of the park. The curve completes and you drop back down into a trench that leads into another hill. You soar over the top of the Skyride gondolas and  some of the larger animal enclosures and twist into the ride's only barrel roll inversion. Up and down over a few bunny hops until you sweep right. This curve leans into alternating dips up and to either side. Right, left, right, left. It's like going through a slalom ski course but much faster. Two more long arcs over the grasslands and one last 40mph launch up a small hill before you finally slow and approach the station. I know that's a wordy description but there's just so much to this coaster. The ride time is over a minute and a half, which is fairly lengthy for a coaster like this, and I loved every second of it. It's smooth but still exciting, and fast but not scary. I was smiling constantly through every moment.\n\nI can't say enough positive things about this ride. Every bit of it is so much fun and it makes you want to ride over and over again. The lines had died down by the time our visit was coming to a close and I ended up riding Cheetah Hunt six times in that one day. Yes, it really is that good. \n\nEvery ride at Busch Gardens is fun, and a handful of them are excellent, but Cheetah Hunt is the crown jewel that sits above the rest. If you ever find yourself at this park you absolutely must give it a try.",

So much so that I hardly enjoyed the ride.\n\nAfter coming back several times and experiencing shorter lines I began to change my mind.\n\nAs the ride begins you are slowly pushed towards the beginning of the track. The second car has to wait for a while before being launched, the first car is nonstop from the get go. Sometimes I forget what's about to happen. It's always a shock when they launch you. \nAfter launching you swoop around a curve and then downward. This part of the track accelerates you to 60 mph and up a steep ascent. This is by far the best part of the ride. You then twirl around a bit unnecessarily and go down a pretty sweet drop. \n\nThe ride is very smooth. It includes some 'heart line' rolls, which adds to the smoothness. There are three total acceleration magnets. All of them are awesome.\n\nOverall, it's a fairly innovative coaster. It's not like any other that I've been on. The line is frickin' ridiculous though most of the time, seriously.",

You've waited all winter long to grow that extra two inches to be tall enough for the upcoming year. The time has finally come and you are only tall enough for one coaster, but damnit, you're getting on it. \n\nThat coaster is Scorpion, and for this kid, it will be amazing. He will give it a 5/5 rating. For the rest of us in our young adulthoods, it's a simple ride.  All of 90 feet high, one vertical loop, a quick double vortex, and your back in the station. This ride is modeled after a ride buit in a popular 80s theme park called Boblo Island, and its age shows. That int to say it isn't worth a quick ride if you are here on the off season and the line is only 0 to 5 minutes. \n\nIf you have kids and want to ride something with them, this is the one in this park. If you are an adult, keep it moving lol\n\nI give scorpion a very middle-grounded 3 out of 5 stars",

I was probably literally 6 or 7 years old when I rode this for the first time nearly 30 years ago and let me tell you - it was a super scary, thrilling ride.  Honestly, I still find it a really scary coaster, partly because it is SO small - the cars are tiny, how close you are to the track, how much you can feel the track moving with you - all of it is REALLY intense compared to the modern super coaster.  Still a great little ride and one of the few still remaining from back in the day (RIP Python - I loved you).",

A somewhat small lift hill immediately drops you into the rides one and only loop which is followed by one long wide left turn and a switch into a tighter \"whirlpool\" style turn where you get completely horizontal before coming to a stop. It's not amazing, but there is nothing wrong with it either. You can tell its an older style of coaster, but its still a smooth ride and it has a certain charm to it. I wouldn't wait in a huge line for a chance to ride this one, but it is certainly still a fun experience.",

A heads up on the line... the ride only has 2 seats per row and there are only 9 rows so you can only at max get 18 people per ride so this line moves pretty slow compared to other rides that sit more per row. Then take in count the fast pass (or whatever they call it at Busch Gardens). \n\nThey have an employee at the ride to tell you what line to get into to help make things go faster but you can request a specific row. We chose the front row which on this ride isn't the front the entire time. The ride goes up and then quickly goes backwards a few times. The design of this ride is like one big circle so they also cannot pre-board riders for the next ride. \n\nI had a giant goofball next to me (Ben) so I was pretty much laughing the whole time but I did notice that while going up and around a curve that you can get a great view of the sunset.

People wanted to leave and they were made to go through the entire line backwards, not allowed to go through the emergency exits or allowed to exit through the front. I think that needs to be fixed.  \n\nThe interactive portions of the ride are pretty fun. The projection Snake king is awesome. I loved the 2x I saw it, the rain and the fire aspects were nicely done. It's clear that they put quite a bit of effort into the themeing and lay out in the queue line.

      "text": "My second favorite ride at Busch Gardens goes to the Cobra's Curse. It's easily one of the most unique coasters I've ever had the pleasure to ride, and that's anywhere, not just at this park. The instant you clear the line its an experience. You don't just wait to get in a cart, sit and get your belt checked. It's a little more complex than that. You're put on a continuously moving conveyor belt where you have to quickly move over to your seat and get settled before the ride starts. There is constant supervision from park staff, but the hectic nature of this set up kind of gets the adrenaline going before the real ride even starts. \n\nOnce you're locked in you move through a short tunnel and then you get the first good look at the FREAKING ELEVATOR in front of the giant cobra statue. I've never encountered a lift system like this before. Most rides have a chain driven lift hill, some have hydraulic launch starts, not the Cobra. Cobra's Curse has 70ft tall elevator with complicated internal mechanisms that lift a cart full of guests on a floating piece of coaster track while simultaneous lowering another piece of track to meet the next cart below. It's pretty incredible.\n\nThis ride can be split up into three stages. Stage one begins when the elevator finally reaches the top and you come face to face with that giant cobra statue. You start curving into the first drop and go through two or three big sweeping curves before you slow down. Just as you come to a full stop you hear a click and stage two begins. Your cart turns a full 180 and you start down the next hill backwards. A few more twists and turns in this new orientation and you slow once more. At this point you go up a little hill and you hear another click. Stage three. Once you come over this hill the best part of the ride starts. Huge high banked turns and twists and all the while you're SPINNING! That last click undid whatever pins kept you in place and both sets of seats (two per cart) spin wildly and independently for this last section. It's like being on a tea cup ride while simultaneously being on a roller coaster and its an experience I've never had anywhere else. \n\nCobra's curse isn't the biggest ride in the park, or the fastest, but it has so much style. It is an absolute must ride if you're visiting Busch Gardens.",

      "text": "Falcon's Fury was intense, but I have to say Sheikra is my favorite ride at Busch Gardens. It gives a nice view of the Tampa skyline on the way from the lift hill to the 90 degree drop. The first drop is stomach dropping good fun, even if slightly less intense than Cedar Point's Valravn, which stands 30 feet higher. Sheikra rides nearly as smoothly as Valravn, though, surprising to me as Sheikra is 11 years older and Valravn is the absolute smoothest roller coaster I've ever ridden. \n   Where Sheikra really has Valravn beat is the second drop. Dropping into a tunnel is a cool effect that Valravn really could have used to spruce up the second, shorter dive. I even got a little splash of water on one of my tunnel drops. (I rode Sheikra twice, on the right end, front and middle rows.) \n  Sheikra sure is graceful for it's unweldy width and it's force. It's like you're a giant metal ballerina pirouetting around through massive loops and turns. \n   Sheikra was my first coaster with a splashdown and it really seems like it's more for the spectators than the riders. It looks cool from the adjacent food court and there is a splash zone my mom was careful to sneak past, but while riding it doesn't seem too different from a regular brake run. \n    Sheikra is the best coaster at Busch Gardens. I really didn't expect it to blow Cheetah Hunt out of the water like it did.",

The 4 second delay in the drop at the top, really gets the adrenalin going. \nThe ride is smooth and fast.

      "text": "Great ride...but the concept is better than the execution. Actually, let me say that differently.  If you are from central Florida, and this park is what you have access too, this ride is a 10 out of 5 stars. It's amazing in that sense. \n\nHowever, if you are like me, and have been on 140+ coasters in your lifetime, then you already know, an amazing hook, does not make an amazing ride.  There are two drops on this coaster, and they are both great drops, one of them bordering on excellent, and there is a lot of power in the first diving loop. However, outside of those elements, the rest of the ride is just, well, kind of just there. \n\nThis is to no fault of the engineers. I mean seriously the elements are great, but unfortunately because of the uniqueness of the actual trains on this thing the layout can't be too much more than it already is. \n\nIf you we're to ask me is it a reason to come to this park, my answer would weigh heavily on how much coaster experience you have.  If we are talking Florida coasters only, then it is a top 10 coaster. If we are talking the county, then it isn't even on my top 25. If you've never been on a coaster this will make you poop on yourself from fear. You decide. \n\nSheiKra is a great ride and should you find yourself in Tampa Bay, it's not to be missed. I give SheiKra, a 4 out of 5 stars",

But sometimes the wait for that can be ridiculous. SheiKra is a very large coaster and the line usually moves quickly since they have several cars going at once and each can hold 24 people. It's not a ride with a long duration so people are on and off pretty quickly. The first drop is awesome and you get breathtaking views of all of Tampa when you get to the top. The second drop is really awesome too and you are whipped up and over a water area which is pretty cool. The thing that I love most about this ride is the size of the track. It's huge! Very very smooth coaster and a must ride if you are in the park. My friend hates it, but I always get her to ride it....and she laughs and smiles every time we do :)",

I know it looks scary, but if you have done roller coasters like Goliath at Six Flags Over Georgia that go up 200 feet, you can do this. It's a very intense ride, they hold you about 4 to6 seconds before they let you go. So much fun! The 2nd drop, which I think is 130 ft., isn't bad either, you then go across water, with the back wheels splashing the area behind. If you stand close to the coaster, you will get wet. so after that the ride is pretty much finished. This is definitely a rollercoaster that you have to ride when at Busch Gardens. Don't be afraid to ride, it because it is a really fun and intense ride. I could ride this ride multiple times. Overall, Sheikra is a coaster you have to do and it's a fun roller coaster.",

Then they hang you over the edge and my friend pops off \"here we go! 5,4,3,2...\" And I was like...you sound like our personal trainer but it dropped us before I could say anything except the F word, so we just went with that. The initial drop was the worst part but the rest was magnificent. The second drop was also intense but not like the first. \n\nI'm glad I worked myself up to SheiKra, but I really wasn't prepared to ride it this early in my coaster career! I'm about this life now! Next time we will do Kumba.  And maybe Tigris if they have their crap straight.",

Me neither, but I imagine this ride is as close to that feeling as it's safely possible to achieve.\n\nThe idea is this: take a car of 24 people, hang it on the edge of a 90 degree vertical drop, and let go!  Instantly, you're falling and weightless and pulling g-forces as you again climb into a loop and up a hill to drop vertically, yet again.  \n\nYou whip around the landscape of the Southwest portion of the park to end the ride by splashing bystanders with rooster-tail water spouts.\n\nA ride all too quick is the only thing, for me, that keeps this from a 5-star rating.

I always avoided any Busch Garden trips as I had no desire to go on roller coasters, but after a good convincing from my friend, I decided to give it a try. I remember a few years ago when I heard about Sheikra opening I thought to myself - I would never get on that! 90 degree drop? You can't pay me to ride ride that! But guess what? I rode it, for free, and it was AWESOME. The only shitty part was that literally right when it took off, it started pouring. Not light sprinkles of rain, I'm talking massive freezing drops of rain. Hitting me in the face at lightning speed. It sucked, my eyes were closed the entire time. I only opened them right at the top of the 90 degree drop (they leave you hanging for what seems like eternity). My heart felt like it was going to stop lol. But it was over so quickly, and once it was done I was sad about it! I actually loved it! I can't wait to go back to Busch Gardens!",

Then as if they haven't tormented you enough the sick designers of this coaster have another surprise in store for you. They dangle you off the edge of the first drop. After what feels like 20 minutes you are finally released to plunge almost straight down. One thing is certain: I will be screaming louder than a 12-year-old girl at a Justin Bieber concert.

Not until after we slowly climbed 200 feet in the air and were tilted downwards to take off did it hit me... This was going to be one wild ride!\n\nWhy the front row? That first drop feels so much more exhilarating when there is nothing between you and the ground below. From there, we went flying down and around. It was nighttime so even harder to see where we were going (in other words, all the more fun!). \n\nLike Falcon's Fury, I am ever impressed by how comfy this ride really is.

The pause is just long enough to really get your heart rate up! The rest of the coaster is a ton of fun with great drops and loops. \n\nMy #1 favorite coaster at Busch Gardens, for sure! Definitely worth a ride (or two)!",

      "text": "Everyone has their preference as far as where to sit in the cart on a roller coaster, but this is the one ride at Busch Gardens where I strongly encourage you to wait the extra few minutes for the front row. \n\nSheikra has an incredibly unique design and is such a fun ride, it's my third favorite at this park. Sheikra is a floor-less dive coaster and that means a few things. First, sitting at 200ft above the ground it's pretty tall. Second, the dive part means the first hill takes you into a full 90 degree drop straight down at 70 mph. Third, the floor-less describer is pretty literal. The carts are designed so they hold you from behind and even though they are mounted to the track underneath, they're is nothing directly below your feet. It's like being on a suspended roller coaster but there's nothing above you. In the heat of the moment it really is like you're just flying through the air held by nothing. If it weren't for being able to see the track you'd think you were sitting in a magic chair, which is especially true if you're on the outside edge of this giant eight wide, three deep wing of a roller coaster cart.  \n\nMy reason for encouraging front row is apparent when you get to the top of that first hill. Right before you drop the cart stops for about three seconds, and if you're in the front row you're seat is stopped over the crest of that hill. It's an insane rush literally hanging from a shoulder harness 200ft in the air right before a true vertical drop at highway speeds. This goes into a full loop and then up a smaller yet still impressive second hill. Two more curves and then a dive into a piece of track nestled in a pond that spews water out both sides (onto to other park patrons if their not careful) before coming to a stop. \n\nThis is an incredible thrill ride and ranks among my favorite coasters of all time. It is an absolute necessity to ride Sheikra!",

The park was fairly empty for both days we were there. We ate at the Zambia Smokehouse. For $13 and change I had ribs, chicken, and beef brisket. More than I could eat, and it was delicious! Buy the souvenir cup, and get free Ice-water, or .99 refills all day of sodas, or icees. \n\nThe park was easy to get into, and easy to get out of. Sheikra was the best coaster. She won't disappoint. Looking forwar to booking the specialty tours. Theres enough of them to last me all year. Check them out before you come. As several of these require a reservation.\n\nSee you there!",

Other people was complaining as they waited over an hour n not been call in to see Santa himself:(.\n\nOther than that the roller coaster.. No waiting time.. My 12 years old son got on n off rather fast.. He got to go on all the rides that he couldn't during normal hours.. He was happy:)\n\nWe took family pictures with those photographers..

Busch Gardens doesn't rely on crappy singers...why? Because they have a collection of top-notch roller coasters, water rides featuring the finest of   Tampa Bay area's teenage girls in wet t-shirts and lots of beer. It's true...you know those old men hanging out by the Tidal Wave have an ulterior motive. The food offered here is also surprisingly good for a theme park...they actually have a very nice restaurant where you can sit down and pretend to be classy. Oh, and I think they have something to do with animals...like a zoo or something? But, really, who cares about that....roller coasters rock!",

As I had a few days in Tampa I thought I would check out Busch gardens for the day. \nFew thoughts\nWe ordered tickets online and glad we did for the cost savings.  I Thought admission was on the high end as many kiosks and snack venues were closed and a very limited amount of entertainment available.\nStaff-- at the animal exhibits the animal keepers were awesome.  At the tiger exhibit - we had a great experience with Jody. She was so interesting and we learned a great deal .\nIn the parks most staff appeared less than happy to be there and did not engage the guests. Many were not able to answer questions regarding how to get to a particular attraction. We took the train ride around the park and were less than impressed with our conductor.  Guests on the train did not appreciate the \"humor\" and would have far more appreciated a narrative of the animals we were seeing.  Election jokes were definitely a taboo topic based on yesterday's results.\n\nI recall seeing more entertainers and a far more exciting atmosphere.  ..... I know it has been many years but overall I was disappointed  - and my family that joined (first timers)were even more so as our day did not live up to their expectations",

Great variety of roller coasters- REAL roller coasters, not those mediocre ones. Cheetah Hunt was really neat. Loved the rapid acceleration at different intervals throughout the ride. Sheikrah also rocked! Incredible ride! My husband really enjoyed Falcon's Fury, too! If you love roller coasters, you will love Busch Gardens. \n2. Affordable and well-kept. It was a good deal and worth the money. \n3. The animals and wildlife areas were very nice, and the park is large enough to keep you busy and entertained. Unfortunately we got rained out before getting to ride most of the rides, but they looked good. \n\nCons: \n1. TOO MANY RIDE CLOSURES! Kumba & Stanley Falls flume ride were closed, and the Congo River ride failed to impress. We barelyyyyyy got wet. The ride needed more water falls to provide opportunities to get wet, and maybe some theming. It was visually boring. The Tidal Wave ride had been closed permanently, leaving a serious lack of water rides. It's Florida and it's HOT, so a couple of good water rides are in order. Tried to get on the sky ride and it was closed. 10 minutes later as we were walking we saw people riding it so that was annoying. \n2. The park has areas with rides that have been permanently closed for years, but nothing has been done with the space (Gwazi and Tidal Wave). From a PR standpoint it just doesn't look good. Tear it down or open it up, but don't just leave it sitting there. It's kinda sad seeing a beautiful wooden coaster abandoned :(\n3. Not all areas of the park are open at opening time. They stagger the opening of the areas, which is a little annoying. The entire park should be open and accessible when be park opens its doors. I guess it's their way of controlling costs and if it keeps ticket prices reasonable, I guess I can't complain too much. \n4. Hours of operation are limited. Wish they were open a little later into the evening and a little earlier in the morning. Again, possible cost control and I can deal with it as long as tickets prices remain reasonable. \n\nOverall, I will return, but I really hope they will improve on some of the cons...",

At afternoon then rainy weather, then they closed every attraction, even the train that surrounds the property. At least we could only ride one rollercoaster the hole day.",

My favorite time of year to go to Busch Gardens is for Howl-o-Scream. \n\nYou can ride all the roller coasters at night, and still hit up the haunted houses for a bit of extra scary. \n\nAnd their roller coasters are awesome! They have probably the best group of coasters in Florida. I could ride Shiekra all day.",

Once we got to park it seemed the mind started spinning trying to figure where to go and what to do with the passes that was never instructed to me and the park employees didn't seem to know the right directions also sending us all over the place wasting our first day did better shopping then enjoyment. My wife and I argued on our anniversary from such a crappy vacation it was not worth the money and we will never return. Then Sunday we went on a safari truck thing wife and I enjoyed feeding the giraffes and all but that seemed to the main attraction and excitement  I paid $800 for 4 different safari animals seems I paid this much for feeding the giraffes and fuel to run the truck. Again the only thing this day being Sunday that was good was the day we checked out and went to the Clearwater beach that we didn't have time to stay just travel there to see the beach because I wasted my time at a safari and fuel show. Sorry to be so honest but if i were able to get half of my money returned not just for the money but because it truly was not worth the full amount I paid.",

      "text": "DON'T GET THE ALL DAY MEAL VOUCHER.  Busch Gardens clearly is only interested in taking as much of your money as they possibly can.  With a great roller coaster, Sheikra, and a so-so one Cheetah, the rest are lack luster and aging.  We have multiple annual passes to several of the Orlando area parks and thought we'd venture out to Tampa for a day in Busch Gardens.  Desiring a hassle-free experience, we bought the passes, the line hopper ultimate passes, along with the all day meal plan (Unlimited food and beverage).  The meal plan, we mostly wanted so we didn't have to drop $5 an hour on bottled waters or cokes.  Well, after several failed attempts to find a kiosk or stand that would honor the voucher, we eventually learn that you can only use it in the actual cafeteria/restaurants which are limited to one per park area.  These cafeterias have the longest lines because they serve full meals.  ...so for refreshments, this $30 option is a total waste.  We saw one such cafeteria with a twenty minute wait in the food area, but no one in the refreshment section, nor at the checkout counter; we proceeded to grab a bottle of water and see the cashier - but were immediately 'SCOLDED' in front of everyone and told we needed to wait in the food line.  The amount of time they spent trying to dominate us and embarrass us in front of others, they could have just said, have a great day!  --- there's no transaction that takes place otherwise, you simply show your band and walk out.  -- but instead, the cashier and the manager seemingly got off on a power trip by forcing us to put down the water and smirkingly instructed us to follow their rules for no other purpose than there being 'rules'.  What a joke.  Worst customer service I've experienced in ANY theme park.",

BUT, did want to point out, we did the all day eat promotion, and found it to be very money saving.  It is on sale right now ($15 instead of $39).  But even at $39 still a good day.  Especially if there all day.  There are several good restaurants, and we found the wait normally to not be more than 10-15 mins.  You get a main dish, a side or desert, and a drink.  Small catch is that you can only eat once per hour, but even still at that, a good deal.  Most meals are about $15-20, so even eating twice pays for it, and eating 3 times you have save quite a bit.  \nOther than that, good coasters, longest we waited was 40 mins, overall good experience.",

Fui a visitarlo ya que soy un apasionado de ese tipo de atracciones y no me defraud\u00f3. Pero la ubicaci\u00f3n no justifica hacer el viaje desde Orlando cuando hay atracciones similares y hasta mejores en dicha cuidad. De hecho, 2 de las 3 monta\u00f1as rusas de Sea World (Manta y Mako) superan a las de Busch Gardens. La que m\u00e1s disfrute fue Falcon's Fury que consiste en una ca\u00edda de una torre de casi 100 metros de altura. Esta dividido en zonas con nombres de pa\u00edses de \u00c1frica y tambi\u00e9n tiene \u00e1reas de zool\u00f3gico, aunque como no me interesan no les prest\u00e9 atenci\u00f3n. Tiene un telef\u00e9rico y un tren que recorre el parque. Adem\u00e1s tiene juegos que te hacen acordar de viejas \u00e9pocas y que se disfrutan mucho. Para los que vayan desde Orlando, hay servicio de micros gratuitos de la empresa Mears Transporation que son muy convenientes ya que permiten disfrutar del parque durante muchas horas. Tiene varias opciones de comida a precios razonables. Cuenta con un sistema de lockers muy pr\u00e1cticos que no utilizan llave (se ingresa un c\u00f3digo) y permite utilizarlos en distintas zonas del parque por un m\u00e1ximo de 2 horas en cada locaci\u00f3n. Lo malo como en todos los parques de la zona son las molestas interrupciones por lluvia.",

The landscaping in some parts of the park are outstanding, but in other areas (like beside Montu) it doesn't live up to the standards set in my mind by it's sister park in WBurg.\n\nWhat this park lacks in landscaping in some areas is made up by the great attractions they have.  Kumba is a ride not to be missed.  It continues to retain it's smoothness while also being one of the most forceful coasters you'll ever experience.  It's fast and it keeps it's speed through the terrain.\n\nOne thing I can tell you is that the loaded cheese fries are awesome, but make sure you don't eat them near any birds, they will dive bomb your snack.\n\nAll in all, if you get a chance to make a trip here, do it, you won't be disappointed.",

Maddening. Arrive at the train station and only after a twenty- five minute wait we advanced ten spots to be advised that the next rain would be around 40 minutes.

Using the Busch Gardens App to get around the park, nowhere did the app show the hours of operation for the various restaurants.  It just said \"All Day\".  Having spent the day waiting in lines, we had decided to wait until 5 p.m. To eat.  When we got to the Serengeti Restaurant it had closed at 5 and the Pub closed at 4.  We booked across the park to eat at the Zambia Smokehouse and got there at 5:28 p.m. The cashier told us they close at 5:30.  As it wasn't 5:30 she said they go off of their cash registers.  There were still people in line so we asked to speak with the manager, Christian.  He stood back and wouldn't come to talk to us so we walked back to him.  I couldn't believe how rude he was.  He was dismissive and as we started to walk away he said loudly \"have a nice day\" with a sarcastic laugh.  \n\nWe then went to the front where we purchased the passes and asked to speak with a manager.  We were told one would be with us shortly.  After standing there for 30 minutes and not one person acknowledging us we decided to just leave.  So disappointed in the service (being that they are in the customer service business), lack of concern and overall uncaring attitudes, (along with filthy restrooms) we will never be back.  Living only 2 hours south this is unfortunate.  \n\nIf you are going to visit, and don't plan to eat every hour, don't buy the All-day dining pass....and if you ever need to speak with a manager?

They are constantly changing & improving.\n\nThe Reasons Why Busch Gardens Rocks...\n1. The roller-coasters are fun. SheiKra is a 90 degree drop roller coaster that is awesome & so much fun. The Montu is an inverted roller coaster with a lot of twists & flip. Kumba is a traditional roller coaster, but don't think traditional means boring. It is fast & has plenty of corkscrews & flips. I haven't been on Cheetah Hunt yet, which opened in 2011. There is also a new roller coaster I'm very excited about called Falcon's Fury. It just opened a few days ago & sound insane. It is like Tower of Terror in the sense that it drops quickly, but the cool part is that the riders are tilted 90 degrees facing straight down...Can't Wait!\nGwazi is the only one that I'm not a huge fan of. Seats are too small & it bounces my head around.\n\n2. The zoo portion is great. I sometimes go for a couple hours & just look at the animals. The hippos, lions, and gorillas are cool because you can get up-close & personal thanks to some very thick glass. The Skyride gives a holistic view of all of the animals & the entire park. The have a wide variety of animals.\n\n3. They have a good mix of roller coasters, animals, & shows. They have water rides too. It is great for big groups with friends & family. It is also great to pop into for an hour or two. Parking is never an issue.\n\n4. It is centrally located in Tampa & very close to the interstate. It is surrounded by numerous restaurants.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey used to have a brewery on site that you could tour. They also used to give free samples of beer (2 per person).\nNo more free beer is kind of a bummer.\n\nBottom Line: BG is amazing. Every time you go you will have fun. If you live in Tampa, you should definitely get an annual pass.",

Slow and unorganized first off the food all day pass buy one get one i couldn't tell you how many times they messed it up and charged me twice lol. And then the quick Q pass, that you had to fight the regular lines to not even be directed to a row it was every man to themselves i mean if im gona be paying basically a second ticket i should atleast be directed or have correct organization, also it looks like you guys are a bit short of staff on the rides but pretty awesome park!",

We arrived and stood in line for about an hour before it started storming and the ride was rightfully shut down. We waited in the queue for close to 4 hours thereafter waiting for the weather to clear up. Btw, no other ride was operating. The weather never really cleared up, no rides started operating during this time, and we left. We talked to information services about a refund and all that was offered were tickets for another day. That's nice and all if we had another day, but we don't. In essence, we paid $300 for nothing except waiting around for 5 hours. The service representative only could say \"you're not the only one.\" Never again will I support Busch parks. This is unfair and a rip off.",

It's the hot chick's younger sister who's got a peg leg and a lazy eye.\n\nThe coasters looked interesting, but either hurt like hell (Gwazi, and I like the Cyclone in Coney Island), made me and my boy sick (Kumba) or were just boring (Sheikra).  Even on an empty empty Monday, it wasn't worth it as so many of the rides were just bad.  \n\nNever to mentioned in the same sentence as Cedar Point or BG Williamsburg, even Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson NJ is a bit better.  This park is just older, massively laid out with long walks from ride to ride, and the rides themselves are just less than good.  Sheikra looks cool and is great in concept, but once the first drop happens after the hang, it's very pedestrian.  Montu, on the other side of the world, is almost identical to Batman at Six Flags Great Adventure, which first came out in 1993.  \n\nWhen entering Rhino Rally, the driver said \"Lower your heads and your expectations\"  I wish I had done more than that for the entire park.",

The park had a peaceful African Safari vibe.  Immediately after the park was bought the vibe changed to a carnival like vibe.    Prices went up and quality went down.  The condition of the park makes me think that no money is spent on maintenance.  Wood rotten and landscape not cared for.  The food has never changed and has always been marginal.  I gave the park another try and it has gotten even worse.  And when my family went to get on a ride the billboard was saying it was a 30 minute wait and the girl working at the entrance of the ride told them there was a 45 minute wait.  So they went to a kiosk to see what the cost was for a fast pass and not only was the pass not affordable but as it turns out the wait time was just 10 minutes!  The fake wait times being posted and told seemed like a scam to get people to purchase the 50.00 fast pass.  The employees that work the tram system are rude and treat people like they are breaking the law.  Not a good friendly vibe.   Everything in the park is dirty and low class.  The exact opposite of what the park was when owned by Busch.  I will never be back.",

      "text": "I have been living in Florida for twelve years, and had never been. I know.. you are thinking \"WHAT?\" but I love, love, love Orlando and its parks, Disney, Universal, Sea World... but I have a new found love for roller coasters (who knew?) and was told this was the mecca. \n\nFinally we made it here. We got in late - an hour before closing, so we got the tickets for the rest of the season and decided to roam around to get to know the park so we could hit it early the next morning. \n\nOK, call me an idiot, but I was walking around going \"Busch?\" and pointing out to my hubby that the logo to Anhauser - Busch logo was on the faucets in the bathroom (bear with me, we had been driving for hours, were tired and it was 8PM). We saw the documentary \"Beer Wars\" recently and I was like dude, is this an AB park? As I walk around with my Stone Brewery t-shirt that says \"Fizzy Yellow Beer Is For Wussies\".. I swore I was going to get kicked out. Who knew? Not me. \n\nSo next day I carefully avoided said tshirt..... man, this place rocks. On Tuesday night we did try out Gwazi (not a fan, I realized I HATE wooden coasters) and Montu. Which is now on my top 2. LOVE IT! \n\nThe park is very nice, you don't feel like you are in a 'park' most of the time. More like a zoo. Unfortunately the next day there was a tropical storm in the morning and flooded a couple of things so we couldn't go on the train or the Rhino ride, but hey - NO PROBLEM. \n\nI got to see the Clydesdales (they are soooo sweet), the animals, and we rode SheiKra, Montu (YAY), Kumba (awesomeness) and the sky ride. \n\nThe park is virtually spotless, and the attitude of the employees is for the most part very good. The food as in any park is overpriced but hey, what do you expect. I do love a park that encourages beer drinking! \n\nThe few cons though, getting around is a bit confusing and long, and the decor is very kitch Lion King 90's. \n\nOtherwise, I AM A FAN! I will be back very soon to ride Montu and Kumba.",

Theres a lot of roller coasters to choose from if your the roller coaster daredevil person but we went here with our 2 year old so we end up on the Sesame street section which he loved. He was able to meet the sesame street characters and take pictures with them and he got a lot of loot as well, although be ready to pay quite a lot as the items are expensive.  We also took the train ride which goes around the park but the view is probably better via the skyride.  \n\nI recommend going to this park but if your kids are just toddlers or babies there nothing much to do but walk and look at the park,which to me is enjoyable but to others maybe a waste of money as the park ticket is expensive and you also have to pay for parking. \n\nWe went to busch gardens in May and there was no line ups and not a lot of people. We go to Florida every year so next year we will be back again as we are always not able to see the entire park in a day.",

Being a local, it is incredibly affordable ($13 a month for annual passes that includes parking) and always makes for a great day.\nSome tips: \n-Quick Queue passes are available *inside* the park near the entrances of most popular coasters-so wait to buy one after you've arrived, you may not need it!\n-Don't skip out on the entertainment-the shows are on par with that of Disney, really good productions\n-***It rains in Florida in the summer*** Nearly every day! Don't be blaming Busch Gardens if it rains when you visit-your inability to plan and research is not their fault lol\n-unless you are carrying a backpack or super large handbag, there is no need to rent a locker-all the big rides have cubbies on the loading platforms that can house small purses, fanny packs (please don't wear these tho-eww) hats, sunglasses, etc...\n-have fun!!",

Det finns nog minst 6 berg-och-dalbanor, Nordamerikas h\u00f6gsta fritt fall, 3 st \"bl\u00f6ta\" attraktioner och s\u00e5 mycket mer d\u00e4r till. Man kan \u00e5ka safarit\u00e5g som tar en tur bland vilda djur och man kan \u00e4ven kika p\u00e5 krokodiler och massor med olika f\u00e5gelarter.\n\n\nBlev ganska besviken under bes\u00f6kets g\u00e5ng pga att...\n\n- det fanns ytterst f\u00e5 b\u00e4nkar runtom i parken, utan i stort sett bara p\u00e5 restaurangerna.\n\n-  det fanns hyllplan precis bredvid attraktionen (ni vet efter k\u00f6n precis d\u00e4r man ska kliva p\u00e5), men man var tvungen att l\u00e4gga sin handv\u00e4ska i ett myntsk\u00e5p utanf\u00f6r \u00e4nd\u00e5. Hur liten v\u00e4skan \u00e4n var fick den inte l\u00e4ggas i facken d\u00e4r uppe... Blev till slut mycket pengar som lades bara p\u00e5 sk\u00e5p.\n\n- P\u00e5 m\u00e5nga skyltar in till restaurangerna st\u00e5r det ett \"lockpris\", som i sj\u00e4lva fallet \u00e4r endast f\u00f6r personer med f\u00f6rk\u00f6pta typ \"all inclusive\"-kort. Nedanf\u00f6r i liten text st\u00e5r det pris som i stort sett 95% av alla bes\u00f6karna m\u00e5ste betala. S\u00e5 man blir lite lurad p\u00e5 s\u00e5 s\u00e4tt.\n\n- det var om\u00f6jligt att hitta! Kartorna som var utsatta var alldeles f\u00f6r f\u00e5, och man kunde inte hitta en enda papperskarta n\u00e5gon annanstans f\u00f6rutom vid ing\u00e5ngen till parken. Gick vilse s\u00e5 m\u00e5nga g\u00e5nger, och hade sv\u00e5rt att hitta personal man kunde fr\u00e5ga.\n\n- \u00f6ppettiderna s\u00f6g. Usch vad besvikna vi blev n\u00e4r vi drog dit runt 12, och uppt\u00e4ckte att de st\u00e4nger redan vid 18! Hade vi inte haft quickpasses (som kostade multum) hade vi inte hunnit \u00e5ka mycket alls. Nu hade vi lite tur f\u00f6r parken var inte alls s\u00e5 fullsatt som vi r\u00e4knat med men \u00e5kbanden kom till anv\u00e4ndning \u00e4nd\u00e5. \n\nMen nog med negativitet. N\u00e5gonstans bortom all kritik tyckte jag \u00e4nd\u00e5 om parken. \u00c4ven om det fanns mest berg-och-dalbanor s\u00e5 var \u00e4nd\u00e5 varje unik. En i tr\u00e4, en var supersnabb, en hade rikligt med loopar och en annan h\u00e4ngde man i bla. Jag gillar variation! \nP\u00e5 en restaurang hade de pizzabuff\u00e9/italiensk mat med tillh\u00f6rande dessertbuff\u00e9. Inte helt tokigt n\u00e4r regnet forsade ner precis lagom till lunch.\n\nAnledningen till varf\u00f6r jag \u00e4r s\u00e5 himla kr\u00e4sen \u00e4r f\u00f6r att jag 2014 bes\u00f6kte Universal/Islands of adventures och det \u00e4r f\u00f6rmodligen ingen park som kommer sl\u00e5 dom tv\u00e5. Men har man inte varit d\u00e4r kan jag f\u00f6rst\u00e5 att man skulle tycka Busch Gardens var kalaskul!",

Even the carousel was fun! \n\nIt was nice to be able to walk around the park and have a little bit of everything. If you wanted a break from high speed roller coasters, you could cool off in any of the water rides, and once you were soaking wet, you could walk around and see all kinds of animals (my favorite!) From cheetahs, to orangutans, to elephants to penguins! It was a great variety of things to see and experience! Great for all the family, and going during Christmas time was even better! \n\nOh! And the food! The restaurants were exciting and the food was good quality. I've been to a number of amusement parks and nothing beats the food at Busch Gardens! Get the food wrist band! Worth every penny! You get to eat all you want whenever you want! AND it's food you want to eat! :) \n\nIf you haven't gone to Busch Gardens, I highly recommend it! Just, be patient when trying to take the tram back to your car. Remember, we're all feeling the same way!",

      "text": "Busch gardens is my favorite park. As a florida resident i have been to all of them.and if your looking for fun this is it. Prices are great, if your going at a high volume time invest in the quick queue to skip lines. We paid 250 each for year quick queue passes and 100 each for the fun card which is a 12 month pass for the park. I also reccomend the all day dining deal for 32 whoch allows you to eat a full meal hourly and drinks are unlimited. Ill attach pictures of some of the meals we ate. Our food total for the day was 200 of having paid only 32 each was well worth it. Just make sure you go on a dat where they are open till 9 or 10 and dont forget cafes start clos8ng an hour before the park does so plaj your meals accordingly. L If your getting fun cards dont forget parking is 18-20 extra so have one family member get an annual pass so you can get free parking.\nThe rollercoasters are awesome my favorites being sheikra, cheetah, and scorpion. But really theres something for everyone there. All ages would have a blast. The critters show is my favorite we watch it everytime. The animals are always nice to look at too. The sky ride is fun to do aswell and a great way to save some walking.",

We got VERY close to giraffes, fed them, and they even kissed some of us :)\n\nUnfortunately we lost our camera at this theme park. We filed a claim and if they find the camera, they would send it back to us for free, which is really nice of them. They ended up finding it, but it was smashed and the memory card and battery was missing :( All I wanted was the memory card because my entire trip was on there. \n\nTheir \"fast pass\" system can use some improvement though. For about 30 (I think , I kinda forgot the price) you get to cut the line to all their major rides just once and if you want to cut the line an unlimited amount of times you have to pay more.\n\nI visited in early June and arrived when it opened. We purchased the fast pass thinking it was going to be extremely crowded. It was a waste of money. It did seem crowded but the lines were of no wait (barely any) for most of the rides. The only ride you would REALLY need it for is Shreika which  had the longest line. Should probably ride that one first :)",

Usually you are in a hurry to get there and then in a hurry to complete everything in the park to find out you were exhausted for your efforts and possibly frustrated that you did not get to something.  This time I had an annual pass and would so recommend this option because I realized once I got into the park I did not have to worry about lines or getting to everything.  If something was busy or I got stuck in an area I could always come back the next time I felt like it.  I purchased a two year annual pass that includes parking and everywhere I went in the park I was offered an additional discount on my purchases.  I figured that in the two years I needed to attend the park 3 times to beat the regular admission price.  Which means I can treat it like a park and visit when I want.\n\nThe blessing of the day was it was still relatively cool for Florida and the animals were out and about all day.  In the past I had always really considered Busch Gardens a rollercoaster theme park.  The animal exhibits both in the animal area and the ones mixed in the park near the rides really provides a top notch zoo experience with a wide range of animals.  One future event that I have in mind is they offer an encounter with the animals where you get to go out in a truck and get up close  with some of the bigger animals for an extra fee.\n\nThis is definitely a side of Busch Gardens you need to experience.",

You will not find a theme park with more roller coasters than Busch Gardens in the Orlando/Tampa area. I felt that I would need a solid 2 days to see everything, but we also went during Christmas break so the place was packed.  We only went on one rollercoaster since the lines were so long but it was definitely worth the wait. Cheetah Run is totally badass. Sheikra looks really scary too and was one we wanted to go on when we returned. If I was here on vacation I would seriously consider paying for the quick passes because the lines were so long.  Since we have annual passes we will be back but in the off season when we won't have to sit in lines all day.",

It's the closest way to all of those amazing animals that they have there. Loved all of those events, it was a blast.

We took the Skylift hoping it would compensate, but it sadly did not.  The exhibits which were open were good, although the entire park is showing its age and could use a bit of a facelift. As far as rides, Sheikra from the front seat was truly awesome and Montu's loops were too!!!  We also loved the water rides, although as I write this, an hour after park closing, I am still wet because I truly got soaked! It was also not crowded at all and we had only a 5-10 minute wait for most rides.  We  experienced a lot of food stands and such closing down as with SeaWorld, so that was a bit of an annoyance, but the refill deal is decent. Customer service was pretty good and friendly enough. Our kids said it was a LOT better than SeaWorld and appreciated the shade, mist, and benches throughout. I can tell you that it is not as awesome as I remember from years ago, but could certainly get back to that with a little work.",

Every one of their parks is beautiful, convincingly themed, and packed with amazing rides.\n\nThe roller coasters are all first-rate: Kumba, Montu, Gwazi, Scorpion, and the newest (which, alas, was added after my last visit) Cheetah Hunt. I found all of them to be thrilling, not too rough on the head or neck (as some coasters can tend to be), and well run (keeping lines to a minimum).\n\nOutside of the roller coasters, there are dozens of other thrill rides from the usual suspects you'll find everywhere else to unique safari-like rides you'll only experience here. There's a really cool safari-gone-awry ride that I enjoyed a lot.\n\nThe African theme is well handled and carried throughout the entire park, and actually turns this into a dual theme park/animal reserve. That ensures that even those who aren't fans of thrill rides will have plenty to do and see.\n\nBusch Gardens Tampa is a great park with great rides, definitely worth a visit any time you're in the area or in the mood for an amusement park outing.",

I am not that much of a \"park person\" but we went on a good day hardly any lines the rides were awesome, especially the roller costers! \n\nI am usually not one for animal sancuarys because it makes me feel terrible seeing animals caged, but their set up is wonderful it seems as all the animals have tons of space and clean enclosures its wonderful, i got great views of the tigers, lions, and orangatans which are all my favs to watch!\n\nThe best part was I got to feed and pet kangeroos! it was awesome I will never forget it, they are soo soft!:)\n\none complaint which im sure is a give away, the food is overpriced and its not good! dont get the pizza by the lion king stadum...its yuckayyyy!\n\n:)",

They have a lot of reall exciting rides as well as a safari trail with lots of animals to see. They have some of the biggest turtles I have ever seen. plenty parking with the usual trams to take you right to the gates. Quesues here are not al long as the ones at disney but the park is still busy.",

      "text": "My boyfriend and I have annual passes. We get access to Busch Gardens, Adventure Island, and Seaworld. There is a small, and very affordable monthly payment, and no down is required! If you are a theme park enthusiast, I highly recommend getting this. It's called E-Z Pay. \nAlong with entrance to the parks year 'round, pass holders get preferred parking. This is awesome because no one wants to get out of the park after a long hot tiring day of riding coasters to have to walk a mile or two to your car. Preferred parking leaves you basically in front of the theme park entrance!\nThe customer service here is AMAZING. All the employees and managers are understanding and want to accommodate you so you have the best experience possible. We went one time and it was raining cats and dogs so all the rides were closed. Worst part? We had purchased Quick-Queue tickets. Busch Gardens had NO problem issuing us a credit to get new ones on our next visit. (Unlike SeaWorld who has NO customer service and refused to credit us or give us our money back).\nOkay, onto the adventures and rides! Their roller coasters are SICK! I love them all! Montu is all crazy twists, Cheetah is fast and all over the place (I love the side to side simulation as that of a predator running after its prey), Sheikra has a TERRYFING 90 degree drop, but after it you will LOVE it, I promise! That's just 3, there's many more! \nEveryone seems to love Falcon's Fury except for me. I don't do drop rides! But my boyfriend always loves the thrill of riding this one.\nCobra's curse is new and I had the awesome pleasure of riding it recently!!! The entrance and wait area are amazing. They don't have anything like this in Busch Gardens. There's all sorts of fun things to read and look at. The ride itself was too short. :( But it what we did experience was nothing we have ever experienced before!!! It goes up, sideways, backwards, all ways! It was definitely a thrill!\nOf course, there are also many rides, playgrounds, and shows for the little ones, including a Sesame Street performance!\nI love that they sell all sorts of beer. This just makes the experience THAT much better. I'm not a huge fan of theme park food, but I have to say that their food isn't all that bad!\nThen, they have special events every now and then like Howl O Scream, Food and Wine, and Summer Nights, where they open Gwazi park and there is a giant stage with incredible entertainment!",

      "text": "You get what you pay for. While it may seem Busch Gardens is a better deal than Universal Studios and Disney the upcharges, subpar park, and poor customer service prove otherwise. After visiting Busch gardens probably 50 or so times in my youth they have instituted a mandatory locker policy for all loose items. This is becoming standard for the industry but while universal and other theme parks offer free rentals for your time on the ride, Busch Gardens has seized the opportunity to upcharge you by $1-2 a ride. They claim this is a required by their rides' manufacturers but I find it funny that the rides I rode as a kid 100s of times,which still have areas for you to place your belongings when you enter, now suddenly require Busch Gardens to milk a few extra bucks out of you.\n\nThe park itself is in poor shape. Numerous rides are down due to maintenance issues with no communication to guests about when or if they will be up working again. Of course Busch Gardens offers no refunds on the bags that you are paying to have locked up so you can stand in line for a broken unrideable ride. Hey we have your money the rest is on you seems to be their go to response.  In fact, their customer service is pretty atrocious. We came to the park to attend a concert during their food and wine fest. The tram operator stated that the concert started at 7pm. When we asked why the website said it started at 530 he stated that that was when you could start grabbing seats but that the show itself wouldn't start until 7. Imagine our surprise when we arrived at the concert area at 630 to find the band we made the trip to see finishing their set. We were pretty furious about the situation but received nothing but generic responses from Busch gardens. \n\nThe food and wine fest in particular is a huge rip off. Their sample sizes are incredibly small and at $6-8 a pop the cost is absolutely absurd. They have a sampling pass that brings the cost down to around $5 an item but are you really getting a good deal spending $5 on bottled water or a soda?\n\nIn short, I'm sad to see one of my favorite theme parks of my youth run in to the ground due to greed and a general disdain for the customer. Luckily there are plenty of other great options in Florida.",

Tram and train were good but that's all we ride. \n\nWe had lunch at the barbecue  place and it was very good but you had to yell to get your order heard and condiments ( salad dressing and barbecue sauce were impossible get. \n\nStaff was very friendly throughout the park and very polite. \n\nTrash cans were overflowing by 1:00 and got worse throughout the day. \n\nHighlight of the day was seeing the Frankie Avalon show. He was very interactive with the audience and still has great moves for a 70 year old man.   Truly had it not been for his show I would have felt the day was overpriced. \n If you like Roller coasters then try it but anything else, save your money.",

So we basically know that we can walk out of the park if the line was too long, gets too hot... start raining etc.  Anyways, we went the weekend that the weather forecasting a huge storm coming lol... but it didn't bother us cause we were gonna be in Tampa that weekend anyway, and we figured, it it starts to storm, we'll just leave the park and come back another time.\n\nOk, that out of the way, the day we went, the weather was BEAUTIFUL.  We got there when the park opened its doors, so we were among the first to go in and get on any rides we want.  And with the weather forecast and school just started, there were hardly anyone there.  The line was less than 20 min at most!\n\nWe are both huge roller coaster fans, so we, of course, went on all the major rides and then went on them multiple times.  The roller coasters were soooo much fun.   Our two favs were the Cheetah (for it's smooth and quick speed ups) and SheiKra (hanging and dropping straight 90 degrees).  We must have gone on both rides about 3-4 times each.  For both rides, especially the SheiKra, it's well worth the wait to sit first row/cart.\n\nOur annual passes ran out, but I think we'll have to revisit Busch Garden in the future.",

I love the animals and a small quaint little shops they have.\n\nI think Busch Gardens is the best amusement park in all of Florida but that is just my humble opinion. On the other hand I also think it is gone down and quality since I have been going to visit it for so many years. The rides are not my thing except for some of the specialty ones so I'm going more on the quality of the overall park.\n\nYes I like that they have the beer and some nice restaurants but I wouldn't say I've eaten at any restaurant there that is a five star quality but once again that's my opinion. Personally I think the animals and walking around in nature and enjoying yourself with friends and or family is a wonderful way to spend a day or an evening. So what better place to do it if you're in Tampa then Busch Gardens.\n\nIt if you coming to Florida it's definitely something to put on your must do list because its so unique. Some of us that have been around for years no the changes and noticed them but it's not going to stop us from going or at least not me. I do regret some of the changes I see but, that's not my decision to make, its corporate America.\n\nWhat's a girl to do if you want to go see some giraffes and beautiful scenery and other animals and maybe have a few beers, Busch Gardens is your place to go.",

      "text": "We are previous annual passholders from 7+ years ago (when we lived in the area) and we LOVED this park.  This weekend was our first visit since then.  We were celebrating our son's 8th birthday and decided to go with the 'Kids Play Free' vacation package.  You pick one of their preferred hotels to stay at and you get admission, parking and discounts on food/merchandise for your entire stay (kids 3-9 for free).  GREAT DEAL!  We chose the Holiday Inn Express New Tampa and while it was further away than the other hotels, it did not disappoint.  Great quality and value.  \n\nAs for the parks, while we noticed that there were a lot of new rides and areas added since our last visit, much has not been updated either.  For example, the bathrooms were exactly the way we remembered them.  The log flume ride is looking really worn and wasn't even running the day we tried to ride.  My favorite water ride, Tidal Wave, has since been closed and abandoned and the Congo River Rapids was promising until they closed it down for 'technical difficulties' right after we were buckled in to ride. :-(  Most of our visit the rides were closing down while we were in line or before we could even get in line due to inclement weather in the area.  We understand that the weather is unavoidable, but it's still discouraging.  Especially, when it's sunny and there is no rain in sight. The summer nights food stands were also a disappointment.  The food we ordered was dry and bland. Also, the computers went down right when we tried to pay.  We also bought a refillable souvenir cup to be used for our entire trip.  The price is comparable to Universal's, however, we were expecting more freestyle machines around the park.  They mostly have regular soda machines with just a few choices.  The employees we asked about freestyle machines were clueless as to what we were talking about.  Also, be prepared to wait in line to scan every time you refill.\n\nOn a positive note, we really enjoyed our experience at the Serengeti Overlook Restaurant.  Our son loved watching the zebras and giraffes while eating his meal.  My husband loved the buffet and took full advantage of everything they had to offer.  Service was pleasant and friendly, unlike many other places in the park.  We loved the new rides Cobra's Curse (great for the entire family), Falcon's Fury and Cheetah Hunt.  These were all great, when they were actually open and running.  For those wondering about wearing bags, I was able to wear a fanny pack on most of the rides without a problem, but on Khumba, they asked me to take it off.   We avoided using the lockers for our entire visit.  It's nice that you can still cubby non-valuable items when you ride, unlike Universal, where they make you put EVERYTHING in lockers for the big rides. Our son was able to get a birthday pin from Adventure Outpost to wear on his special day, although only one employee acknowledged him the entire day.  \n\nOverall, it was an okay experience for the valuable package we purchased.  If we had paid full price, I would have been sorely disappointed.  I feel that with a few upgrades (bathrooms, more freestyle machines and cups with chips), tighter reopening times on rides and better training of employees, this park could be a '5' again.  We still love the theme of this park over most others, with the animals and plethora of rides for everyone.  Here's hoping that the current owners do something to turn it around.  'Til next time...",

The weather was terrific, the crowds weren't obnoxious and I saw other Asians in Florida!  I didn't think they made it that far down south.  \n\nThe ride, which I call Shakira, was awesome, shakira, sharika, what a beautiful liar!  Just kidding.  We paid $50 for the season pass and went twice in a month and the rides were still awesome.  And how about the animal reserve.  Well....I did fall asleep on that one from drinking the night before, but it was a nice nap.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens leaves me feeling a bit conflicted. I'm a huge fan of roller coasters and thrill rides but zoos really bum me out. And keeping wild animals in captivity so close to roaring roller coasters filled with screaming riders, well, it seems particularly cruel. \n   BG is a decent value for the money, at least compared to A-list Florida parks like Disney and Universal. It's big and sprawling, but the layout can be confusing and hard to navigate, even armed with the map. I recommend taking the skyride as I love riding cable cars and most parks lack them. They also have a train, if you want to wait for it and expose yourself to too many species of animals living in conditions that are foreign and unnatural to them. Call me a bleeding heart or whatever but I did not enjoy the \"Serenghetti plain\" portion of the park. \n   The theming in other areas is pretty fun. The fat mummy on display in the Egypt area is a hoot. And the food, given that amusement park food has a reputation of being unhealthy and untasty, could be worse. Lunch from the eatery near the Sheikra coaster actually wasn't half bad. It was fun watching the splashdowns from the coaster, too. \n   I even caught part of a musical performance in the Stanley Theater - a tenor by the name of Fernando Varela. He had previously opened for the Beach Boys and Lionel Richie and both my parents and I were surprised by what a top notch act he was. His style of music wasn't quite my cup of tea but I was trying to do some family stuff with the fam instead of just riding coasters all day and man, does Fernando have a set of pipes on him. He held notes on Gloria for an extremely long time and did a very classy cover of the late Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. We only stayed for 4 songs as we only had until 5pm on an abbreviated Wednesday in February, but don't sleep on the music shows at Busch Gardens. \n    Busch Gardens has a respectable, if not elite coaster collection, though not much in the way of flat rides apart from the ferocious drop tower Falcon's Fury. Dive coaster Sheikra was hands down my favorite and the rest, though lagging behind, were nothing to scoff at either. Even Scorpion, something of a relic and not too far removed from something you might see at a State Fair or travelling carnival, gave a decent, invigorating ride. Lines were wonderfully short, too. I've given each coaster, apart from Cobra's Curse - which was closed for maintenance, individual reviews if you wish to delve into my opinions even further. \n    I was kind of disappointed in the oh-so-early closing time of 5pm, especially since their website billed Busch Gardens as being open til 6, but myself the the 'rents crammed quite a lot into 5 and a half hours here. And if I wasn't so adverse to seeing wild animals forced out of the wild I would be a lot more keen to go back.",

      "text": "If it were possible to leave a review without selecting any stars, this would be the time. We were first time guests at Busch Gardens this past weekend and I can say, it was the worst amusement park experience of our lives. For a park \"known\" for roller Coasters, it was unexpected that rides were periodically shut down without rhyme or reason. We thought it was odd that some coasters would close and then re-open without warning. Frankly the place seemed very understaffed!! The result of the closures was a backlog of \"fast pass\" holders that caused the lines of regular ticket holders to increase from published wait times by an additional one-third. (I.e. Published 60 min wait was really 80 min). Staff would pull us out out of lines on some rides (as the rides were being closed) while other staff allowed guests to remain in line. Staff seemed really confused. The overall park appeared run down and \"tired\" --we saw fountain tiles, signage and landscaping in disrepair. We had the worst day. We were so disappointed and morn the loss of money we paid for 4 people. It's a tragic waste of money! We just don't have anything positive to say about Busch Gardens in Tampa Bay. Please don't bother visiting this park.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens truly has something for everyone, whether you're a thrill seeker, animal lover, or theater buff (I happen to be all three). \n\nSome park highlights for me:\n\nSheikra. This is the scariest rollercoaster I've ever been on (yet I still always go on it, and I'm still just as scared every time). The coaster cart is 3 rows of \"stadium\" seating. This ride is short, but it is really about one 7 second stretch that seems to last forever : when you're precariously hung over the edge of a very high 90 degree drop before the cart drops. Sitting in the front for this one ups the scary factor by a million. \n\nLion exhibit. They are usually lounging right by the observation window, so this is probably the closest you will ever get to a lion without losing a limb. \n\nIceploration. An ice show featuring figure skaters, pair skaters,  incredible puppetry, and animals. It's a really cute story with some beautiful set and costuming. A nice 30 minute break from the heat, too!\n\nI typically feel overwhelmed at theme parks but since I have a season pass I don't feel pressured to fit a ton of stuff in every time I come. Sometimes I just go to see shows, other times I just ride rollercoasters. I actually think this is the best way to enjoy the park. Don't try to do everything, but instead just pick a few must-dos and fit in whatever extra activities you can.",

      "text": "This is a great park! We attended the park on Sunday, 6/21/15. It was a very hot day & the park was pretty busy. \n\nPARKING & GUEST RELATIONS... Parking was very organized and there is a nice tram that will take you to the entrance. Just make a note of where you parked!\n\n   Once inside the park, we stopped at Guest Relations to pick up a medical fast pass for my son who is type 1 diabetic & can't stand in long lines due to the heat. They happily gave us a pass which is a slip of paper with a list of all the big rides where the ride operators can write down a time to come back to avoid standing in the long lines. This pass is good for your entire group. We actually ended up not really needing it because there was never more than a 15 minute wait on the rides and sometimes no wait at all! \n\nTHE RIDES... We started at the very back of the park and the 4 roller-coaster riders in our group rode Kumba, which they all loved. Next was Shreika, which they also said was awesome. They rode the Montu, which looks very similar to Batman the Ride (Six Flags) but they said it was way better. But their favorite ride was Cheetah Hunt because it is such a long and smooth roller-coaster. They decided to skip Falcon's Fury.\n\n   There are digital signs throughout the park that list the wait times for the rides which was super helpful, & I also highly recommend using their interactive app called Busch Gardens, which will tell you the wait times, as well as how far of a walk you are from the ride, & will actually navigate your steps to the ride. It will also tell you the thrill & splash level, as well as the height requirement. \n\nTHE ANIMALS... And for me, the non rider (& mom) of the group, my favorite part of the park was the built-in zoo! Yes! Lots of animal exhibits throughout the park & the animals all seemed to be enjoying the attention. Be sure & stop by the Tiger Tunnel & Tiger Viewing area. The tigers will come right up to the window! There is a walking safari in Edge of Africa where you will find lemurs, meerkats, lions, etc. Also, don't miss the walk through bird sanctuary. My son stuck out his finger and the bird walked right up on his shoulder. My daughter tried it with a different bird and it bit her but she said it didn't hurt. I didn't discover till after our visit that there are a lot more animal attractions that we didn't get to (Walkabout Way, Jambo Junction, etc.) So if you're really into animals, be sure & check out the website before you go and make a note of the animal exhibits you don't want to miss. \n\nTHE STAFF.. I also found the staff to be friendly and professional throughout the entire park. Any of the food stands & kiosks happily filled our generic water bottles with either ice or ice water, depending on what machines they had, so we were all able to stay hydrated on this hot 98 degree day. (If they only had ice, they would just point us to a nearby water fountain.)\n\nFINAL WORDS... My group had 5 people consisting of 2 parents and 3 kids ages 15-20. We ALL thoroughly enjoyed this park and it was a refreshing change from what we experience back home at Six Flags St. Louis which is always rude people,  overpriced, disgusting food, and no free water or ice to speak of. We would definitely return to Busch Gardens and recommend it to family and friends. \n\nTICKETS... We purchased our tickets online and saved $85 per ticket by purchasing the Busch Gardens/Sea World combo. Check online & buy/print your tickets ahead of time to save money and skip the long lines at the gate.",

Now, a 40 minute wait really isn't that bad, but it was every bit of 40 minutes if not longer. This time could have been easily reduced by adding 2 more employees to unload/load the coaster cars.\nI mean, when your crew deals with one car at a time while 2 others are \"stacked up\" behind it waiting to unload...WDW would have been all over it.\nOn the other hand....the roller coasters themselves were outstanding!!\n\nIt would have been nice to know up front that the animal viewing train was not running during our visit. \n\nAs noted in another review, pay the extra $2 + tax ($24 total) to get the \"preferred parking\" and save yourself from having to wait for a tram.\n\nJust a note to someone who has not been here.....in the summertime when lightening is a very real possibility and danger, Busch Gardens doesn't play around and WILL shut down the rides if there is inclement weather potential in the area.\nAND if it does start down-pouring, there are not many places to duck into to get out of it.\n\nFinally a suggestion for the technology experts with Busch Gardens, fix your mobile app to show wait times for the rides.",

Today we rode all the coasters and I'd have to say that Sheikra is awesome. It takes you to the edge and holds there about 3-4 seconds and then it drops you STRAIGHT down. And the thing is, is that you can't see the track so you get the feeling that you are free falling with no net. It's an unbelievable rush. \nKumba is very fast and is one of the longest lasting coasters around. No real quick ride here. \nMontu is really cool. Your feet are just hanging in the wide open (the coaster is railed from the top, instead of the bottom. \nThe shows are world class., literally. Most of the performers are from different countries from around the world. \nSesame Street section is great for the kids. They get to meet the Sesame Street crew and there are different rides for kids to ride on, 2yrs and up. Our daughter loves the Grover Roller Coaster. every time we go there we have to ride it at least 3 times in a row. \nThey have animals, mainly themed after Africa. Gorillas, Giraffes, Lions, Zebras, and the tigers that are in the Jungala section are really cool to watch. The Tiger Tail Trail really allows you to get close to the tigers, including 2 white tigers. Of course you are separated by glass or some type of netting.",

Me - I did not inherit the roller coaster gene (though it was passed down to my kids), I don't live anywhere near Tampa and I am a bit of a germaphobe - and don't like seeing animals outside of their native habitats, so...\n\nSeriously, this park has seen better days, but it was still crowded. The food and wine fest area was by far the nicest spot - but that is not really the experience you come here for - at least not all year 'round.  The safari experiences are really not my cup of tea. The escorts are kind and knowledgeable but you basically ride around in a large pick up truck and see a few animals in a field.  Giraffes can be hand-fed - cute but also a little sad. The animal experiences are quite pricey, so be prepared.  \n\nSpeaking of pricey, the quick queue tickets to avoid the lines are like $80 a pop if you want more than one repeat ride and a shorter wait time. I was unprepared for that only because the park as a whole is not as nice as Universal and Disney - where you expect to pay those crazy amusement park prices.\n\nConcession foods are - yuck.  But, again, you don't come here for that. The roller coasters are the main attraction, and there are quite a few really good one (so I am told). The folks in the park are also very attentive and super helpful - at least those we met. \n\nThe annual pass is a good deal - again if you live nearby and love love love what there is to love here and can look past the rest.  Hope this place gets an overhaul soon - it can really use it.",

My only complaint about the beer is that it was only available 12-5. They had a variety of BBQ and the places they had were Smokey Bones and Outback. We chose Smokey Bones and basically got a sampler for $10! It was enough food for both of us! It was delicious which is what I would expect from Smokey Bones. The entertainment was not bad either!

      "text": "The park is clean, that's the only good thing I can say about Busch Gardens. It's business practices are mercenary at best. I've visited several times in the last two years and I must say, this so-called family excursion destination leaves much to be desired. The food costs are beyond ridiculous, bordering on outright larceny. Parking rates continue to increase even without any noticeable improvement to the space itself. What is the thought process of raising rates to $22 for general parking or $28 if you have small children and want a spot closer to the entrance? GREED. These are not replaced or shady spots with family areas, nor are they more easily navigable - they are simply closer to the entrance. This is a cost that continues to rise from year to year for no other reason than profit. Tacked onto the already hefty admission costs per person, it's blatantly obvious. There are too few rides in the park to accommodate the number of guests that are there on any given day, so the wait time for every ride is in excess of an hour. BUT, if you pay extra to jump the line, your wait will be shorter than those less fortunate left sweltering in the heat. That's ok too, because, you know, profit. Let's talk about how the weather forecast closes the rides and leaves families nothing to do but walk around and spend money on food and drinks. Yeah you can get a re entry pass good for 30 days, but meanwhile, you are spending money. And when you come back, you'll be spending more money. Because the weather in Tampa is like that. Busch Gardens is not doing you a favor by giving you a free ticket, they are making money off of you every time you pull into their parking lot. Simply said, Busch Gardens is a huge tourist scam and unfortunately, they choose to scam Florida residents as well. They know that they don't have enough rides that run on a regular basis to accommodate their guests on any given day: they're counting on the weather to screw up your visit, they offer a free return visit to lure you in to spend more by giving you the line jump options before the weather kicks off. I was there today, sunny and clear, yet a single cloud later in the day suddenly closed all the rides. We arrived at 10.30am and left at 4pm. My granddaughter rode one ride in all that time... And that ride had over an hour wait. Since I didn't cough up the extra money for her to jump the line, she had a disappointing day. Me? I'm a disabled senior who spent those hours with my 3 year old grandson in Sesame Street in the Splash area. Was that worth the cost of the full price tickets I had to pay? Ummm, no. Busch Gardens does not have a  dilineation for Grandparents or other people who are unable to take advantage of the rides or some of the walking attractions. Again it's just about the money. Moving here from the north, I am truly appalled at the mercenary nature of this place. Busch Gardens could easily charge a nominal fee for seniors that would preclude them from certain rides and activities, but they don't. Just like handicap parking should not be considered as preferred. I had to pay extra because I'm handicapped? Understand in most cases handicapped means social security, like me. Again, this is a fail for Busch Gardens. This entire day, this experience at this so-called family friendly destination left me with a horrible taste in my mouth. I would NEVER recommend this to anyone who wanted an enjoyable outing, either with an equal partner or their grandchildren. Bush Gardens, is sadly just another place that's not worth the hassle or the hype.",

I think that people should come check out the shows. The ice shows are my favorite because of the costume. \n\nI also like learning about the different animals. There are experts that describes the animals life , facts, and health patterns. I think they do a great job to share how they care for the animals. \n\nThere are also rides if you go when it's not peak time you can get on the rides by if you go when it's busy than you will wait sometimes two hours for a ride.

      "text": "We came here to try it out since we had never been here before. I guess it's worth it if you haven't been. As someone who enjoys theme parks and lives close to Six Flags and Dorney and goes to Universal, I was not impressed with this park. The layout is ridiculous to navigate and everything is super spread out. Many of the roller coaster entrances are not easy to find. We got so frustrated the first few hours we were there, we decided to ride the train around the park. \n\nIn regards to roller coasters, once I found the entrances, I had 2 favorites: Cobra's Curse and Cheetah hunt. Cobra's curse, their newest ride, is definitely unique. First off, a platform takes your car to the top of the first hill, elevator style, and off you go! The first 1/3 of the ride is forward, middle is backward, and last is freestyle where your car can spin. (I noticed full cars spin more!) Cheetah hunt is also a unique ride, using the force of rebelling magnets to shoot you from 0-60mph. The rest, in my opinion, were forgettable. Luckily none of these rides had more than a ten minute wait anyway (probably since it's about an hour and 15 minute drive from Orlando!). That was definitely a plus to not wait and basically walk on the rides! \n\nThere are also animal exhibits throughout the park. If you have children, there's a section for them that was not running while we were there. As for food, prices were typical for theme parks, but some places (not all) offered some healthier snack options: orange slices, grapes, carrots and ranch dip, side salad, etc. I purchased an All-Day Dining Pass and feel like I got my money's worth. You can literally get a platter and snack/dessert every hour as well as unlimited (non-alcoholic) drinks all day. I purchased mine online for about $30 I think, but if you buy in park it's $35. \n\nFor me, it was a once and done thing. We got there at 10:30-11 and by 4:30, we were ready to leave (which never happens!).",

      "text": "Busch Gardens Africa was the first major theme park to open in Florida back in 1954. Over time their amount of attraction grew into the South's best park for thrill-seekers. You first arrive at a massive parking lot and take a tram underneath the road to the front gate. One particularly cool idea is the had stilt-walkers dressed in native clothing to meet the kids outside the front gate. Upon 10 am we were off and running to Cheetah Hunt (8/10), an Intamin triple launch coaster, we waited about five minutes for the front and the crew was cranking out trains. After that we visited Cobra's Curse(7/10), the parks newest roller coaster, it's a custom Mack Rides spinning coaster with a rare elevator lift a well themed queue (sadly the projection mapping was broken), and a continuous loading station we waited about 20 minutes. Onto Montu (9/10), the B&M invert, it was about a five minute wait for the front and it's the best inverted coaster in North America. After a busy morning we ate breakfast at Sultan's Sweets, they have cinnamon rolls, muffins, doughnuts, and plenty of other pastries. When we finished chowing down on breakfast we began our walk across the park to SheiKra, (9/10) a B&M dive machine featuring two vertical drops, and a splashdown finale, the crew was cranking out trains so we walked onto the front row. Afterwards we rode Congo River Rapids (6/10) a very standard Intamin rapids ride, with a waterfall cave, and geysers, a five minute wait. I then rode one of the parks large coasters Kumba, (9/10) it's my favorite traditional looping coaster and has 7 inversions, I waited 15 minutes for the front row. After that we walked over to Pantopia and rode Scorpion (7/10) a small but forceful Schwarzkopf looper. We waited one hour only because of one train operations, and the grouper, Shawn, was dispatching trains with up to seven empty seats. After that we ate lunch at Dragonfire Grille, an indoor restaurant featuring a show stage, the food was decent, but nothing special. After lunch it was time to brave Falcon's Fury (9/10) a massive 335 foot tall Intamin drop tower, and the only one of it's kind in the world 90 degree tilting seats. You fall face first down to Earth. In addition to rides Busch Gardens hosts a vast array of animals. There is a massive Serengeti Plain where you can take a train or sky ride and see rhinos, zebras, giraffes, wildebeest, and antelope up close. Scattered around the park are various other animals such as elephants, tigers, lions, hippos, gorillas, alligators, and orangutans. As we walked out at the end of a fun the theme from The Rocketeer played over the speakers. However, it will not be receiving a perfect score due to slow operations on Scorpion, as well as 3 standing but not operating rides (Gwazi, Tanganyika Tidal Wave, and Rhino Rally) Then there was the problem of having a 50's rock 'n' roll show inside an African theater, you would expect native African music not American rock. I recommend this park for coaster enthusiasts, and animal lovers.",

But today I ate a Mexican salad you could put on what you wanted- with a side of guacamole & salsa & chips. The salad was plenty & pretty good & presented nicely. The salsa was good & the guacamole.The restaurant had other themed foods, American, Asian, Italian & the Mexican food choices & it had theater shows & most importantly in the air conditioning:) I live within reasonable driving distance & get season passes. Bush Gardens is a nice day out & has awesome food options for a theme park!!! The rides are Elmo's world for the wee ones & roller coasters & others for adults & shops, restaurant & games & animals which the educate on these animals. Which is invaluable to many of their survival. A bit of something for everyone. I like all the air conditioned spots for guests & the relaxing eye appealing landscaping. The shows are nice to go see & they change it up routinely. A good family day something for everyone & there's plenty of shade:) The train ride through the Serengeti is always fun & also can help you get around the park quickly, it has a few different pick up & drop spots. One of my favorite parks!!!",

There were a few things that were excluded but it really didn't matter. \n\nOrdinarily when you go to a big amusement place like this you pay through the nose to get in and then double that to eat. This was a welcome surprise and much appreciated! \n\nAs for the park and rides! Great fun for all ages, something for everyone. I agree with Steve B. stay away from Gwazi...looked easy hurt like crazy! Sheikra on the other hand our party rode it 3 times!!!! \n\nAND I want to give a special shout out to the park staff, they were spectacular...We lost are car at the end of the night in the monster size parking lot and they calmed our fears and found it for us! \n\nI highly recommend a visit - but check on-line for discounts before you go!",

The park is loaded with exciting rides and is big enough to explore.  It has many exciting features such as the safari and sky rides.  There are animal exhibits all over the park and it even has bird and kangaroo feelings!  Rides  are a blast and the Sheikra is freaking scary! (For me). They have that new ride where it drops you from Mt. Everest.....forget it. I'll pass.\n\nBusch Gardens hosts different festivals throughout the year...from the Food and Wine festival to the Christmas one....it's an awesome place to take the family for a fun-filled day! \nTake advantage of their drink and popcorn cups.  But once and take it with you for $.99 refills.  There are also other options too! \n\nI have been living in FL for over four years and have purchased the yearly passes for three of those!

There are many perks to buying a season pass... free parking, discounts on food and merchandise, free pass for a friend during your birthday month, etc.  I love taking my 2 and a half year old here.  They have an area that is Sesame Street themed with a really cute show where the kids can meet the characters after.  They also have rides, rope bridges, bounce house, interactive water fountains, etc for toddlers and kids a bit older.  My daughter also loves the ice skating show bc of the lighting and music, and the show where they have trained rescued animals (opening night critters).  We also walk around to see tigers, giraffes, elephants, hippo, etc.  \n     I have also taken my mother in a wheelchair and have had no trouble getting her around the park.  Some sections of the park are a little hilly, so I get a little tired but it's not bad.  You can also rent a motorized wheelchair there if you want.",

We both go to school and work full time and never have time for each other. This week we finally had some time and decided to try Busch gardens out...yeah garbage. We got into park and already the rides shut down due to weather so we waited and decided to buy the quick pass so we don't have to wait in line too long when everything finally opens. We waited around, sitting in the rain , for two hours when they finally announced that the rides have opened. We decided to go to one ride and I asked some attendant if I could take my bag with me and she said yes at my own risk of losing it so I went in line as I was walking up some girl that is working the line yells out loudly that I have to go pay for a locker that I can't get on the ride didn't even take that joke of a pass. We didn't use it once. And in order to get money to pay for that freaking locker was at the front of the park to then carry change around. We just paid to sit in the rain and get scolded at in a embarrassing nasty way. I got my money back and will NEVER be returning. This place is a joke and a horrible time. I rather go to Santa's enchanted freaking forest than stepping into this place ever again and that is hard to say. But it's cool go at your own risk people. You will regret it.",

Well I decided to take my partner and niece here for a day and ride some coasters.  I actually am a platinum pass holder and used to frequent here and Sea World quite often.  The pass entitles me to many benefits including free preferred parking, discounted admission for friends and family, discount on food and merchandise, and ride again privelages on certain coasters.\n\nWe went mainly due to the opening of the new roller coaster Cheetah Chase.  This new coaster is amazing!  It shoots you out at around 60 mph, gives you loops and turns, and does some crazy zig and zag maneuvers.  It is a smooth ride from beginning to end and is all around another great addition to the theme park.  Before this addition was Sheikra, the 90 drop coaster, and I was okay with that.  Cheetah Chase is crazy good in comparison.  It was definitely worth the wait.  All in all we managed to ride all the coasters and get soaked on the Congo River Rapids...we totally needed it though due to how hot it was that day.  \n\nMy only advice is to steer clear during summer months...we had half of all Brazilian citizens in the park with us chanting, screaming, clapping, and singing...it did not make for pleasant waits in lines.  That is not the park's fault though so it does not take their rating down for me.\n\nOh...definitely buy a souvenier cup for 99 cent refills!  It is worth it for a day in the park.",

It was dark so when we rode the train around the park we could only see silhouettes of the zebras and giraffes.  It was pretty neat to see the silhouettes against the dark sky with the moon in the background.  To make up for the lack of animal sightings, they had everyone sing Christmas carols as they rode.  FUN!\n\nWe also rode three roller coasters.  I'll start with the worst one:\n\nGwazi...  I knew when I heard the 'clank, clank clank' of the track that I was going to hate it and I was right on!  Talk about Whip Lash. My body hurt when I exited the ride!\n\nShiekra...be ready to scream!  The hills are very tall and you go straight down a couple of times.  I'm pretty sure my heart was in my head a few times!  I was shaking when I exited this one.\n\nCheetah Hunt...my favorite.  Right when you get on the ride you hear the sound of air being pressurized and then it shoots the cars out like a cannon.  After that is one large hill and then the rest are tons of small hills closer to the ground and an underground tunnel.  I would much rather ride this than any of the others.  It's fast, and I felt like a Cheetah for the whole minute I was on the ride!",

We went on monday and the lines were very short, my kids waited no more then 10-15 mins for the roller coasters. Seeing all the animals were great and up close too. We ate at the nicest restaurant they have and used the counter service. The upstairs has sit down service. My shrimp salad was fresh and great for a amusement park. We really enjoyed our day here and would go back if we are Tampa again. We saw two shows, one ice skating type and one madagascar and both were great espically to get out of the 90+ weather or rain. We ate dinner at the smoke house and the food was really good. I would recommend this place to everyone. A lot of young/teens people here and it can be a little ghetto at times but over all we enjoyed our time here. \"\"One tip\"...... it can rain/thunder around 3:00pm so go on any roller coasters before that. They do close them when it rains/thunders as all the parks do in florida even Walt Disney World. See a show during the rain/thunder or eat at the closed in restaurants. The rain actually cools down the high heat which can be great once it stops raining.",

These folks knew the park had no power on the morning of Saturday, May 12th, 2018.  and instead of being honest with the customers they continued to let folks pay and go inside only to find out THEN that nothing was operable including food! I was livid! My 4 year old who has special needs was sitting in a stroller along with the rest of the thousands of disappointed toddlers waiting for the Sesame Street  area to open wondering why they couldn't ride anything! Do you think these people had the decency to even offer water? Nope! They just shrugged their shoulders and said that they have no clue if it's coming back on or not. Totally unacceptable when I paid almost 400 dollars for tickets! I stood in an hour long line for a full refund and here is the kicker......they say it will take up to 45 days! WHAT? It took two seconds for them to take it and I have to wait over a month to get it back? Not even an offer of free tickets for  next time we are visiting! Not even an apology! This whole experience was terrible and could have been prevented with a little honesty at the gate and some good ole customer service. We traveled from Maryland for the Sesame Street weekend and left with my son very confused and upset! The only good thing I will say is that they brought out the characters for pictures once they saw all the kids getting ready to lose it......SAD EXPERIENCE.....should have gone to Disney. I will be informing ALL of my moms groups, school groups, travel groups, and ALL of my social media groups about this debacle. They do not DESERVE our patronage operating like that!",

Falcon's Fury was hands down my favorite!! If you have the guts, definitely jump on!! My grandfather was upset that the restaurant was not open. If you have an extra $30, get the Quick Queue!! It's beyond worth it and allows you to hop right on all of the major rides one time. We used this and it did not disappoint. One thing that I would not buy again is the Photo Key. This would have been much more useful if there were some staff stationed around the park taking photographs once in a while, but we only saw one place where this happened. So all of our photos are only of 3 people out of the 5 in are group that went on the roller coasters. Definitely loved the kangaroo petting area and next time I return, I will pay to feed the giraffes. It is a little hard to navigate around the park... if you want to go on a ride on the opposite end of the park then you have to walk the entire length (unless you take the train, but that would be just as slow, if not slower...) so it makes it harder to navigate to where you want to go and have time for all of the rides. If you're in the area and have a free day, Busch Gardens is worth checking out. I only got to see the animal show and it was GREAT! So even if you are not a ride fanatic, there are still things for you to do at this park.\n\nSide note: If you forget your handicap sticker for your grandfather (or whomever) just ask the parking guards and they will be very lenient with letting you still park in the handicap area.",

Constant ride shutdowns for mechanical problems also they shut rides down for any bad weather eight miles away for an average time of two hours at a clip. You will spend more time waiting then riding. When it rains the park has poor drainage and you will soak your shoes. Was here in July four days in a row and they could not keep rides open. A black cloud hovers over the park and rides are always closed for inclement weather spent 600 dollars for my family what a waste. Think long and hard before you spend a weeks pay here. Even my kids finally gave up and said they wanted to go home.",

      "text": "I recently visited Busch Gardens (BG) after a 5 year absence\n Last time I visited, it was in 2008 with a Mallu priest. lol.\n\nI used the 50 dollar special for me and my gf. I really love all the animal exhibits, especially the elephants, apes, giraffes, flamingos\n. And who doesn't love the Coasters? (except MI patients and my gf)?\n\nCoasters:\nCheetah Hunt and Sheikra were the two new coasters added since my last sojourn. I loved Cheetah Hunt even if it was a bit short. Sheikra scared me away for the moment.\nMy Favorite coaster is Montu. I like the feeling of your feet dangling through the air, and I feel safer with the steel harness over the body. It has a lot of inversions, but It's very fun. Kumba is a little old , but solid. Scorpion is decent for smaller kids or families.\nI cannot recommend Gwazi. the wooden construction gives it a jerky quality, and it does put strain on your neck area. I rode it once circa 2004 but never again.\n\nBG is a great place , but I have  some nitpicks:\n\nParking is 15, which is standard for Disney. but BG isnt that big. I think they could knock it down to 10 honestly.\n\nBG is 1/2 zoo, 1/2 amusement park. Many people , like my parents or gf, dont enjoy the coasters, and wont go on them. I tend to favor the rides more than the animals.\nHonestly the optimal thing would be if you like both and go with people who like both. \nFor people shy of death-defying coasters, the value of a standard ticket (85-90 approx) is a lot less. I would recommend getting a Fun pass if youre from FL. One full ticket , and you can go repeatedly throughout the year\n\n--I went at an atypical time, but be wary of going during Tampas \"rainy season\" - July-Sept)  BG turns off rides at the first drizzle and may not reopen them that for hours.\n\n-- The park closed at 5pm (in December), Universal  and Epcot closed at 7pm. Try and get there early if possible.\n\nThe park was very beautifully decorated for the Xmas season, which was nice. The employees were friendly, and the park was clean. \n\nI had a fun time overall. Maybe I can take anti-emetic meds before going on Sheikra.",

The only line we stood in all day was 15 minutes for lunch at Bengal Bistro. Disney moves people much better, and passengers wait for too long to board rides...but the rides themselves are so much better. Two days later, my shoulders and collarbones are still sore from riding the coasters and being tossed upside down. I must have ridden 30+ times. Sheikra is amazing, Cheetah Hunt and Mantu are world-class. Do Disney if your kids are all under 7-8 or so. Do Busch Gardens if the kids are bigger.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens makes me feel happy. It's a reminder of my first ever foray to the USA. I came to Orlando to sate my appetite for roller coasters.\n\nI had been based in Orlando and enjoyed the Disney and Universal parks but was looking for bigger coasters to ride. I had planned a day trip to Tampa to Busch Gardens and at the time, it was my longest drive in the USA\n\nThe parking lot is huge and a little confusing at first but I've since got the hang of it. Busch Gardens has a nice feel to it. Slightly less corporate than Disney though that may just be an illusion.\n\nI wasn't disappointed by my wish for larger coasters. On my first trip, I truly my brain truly scrambled by multiple rides on Kumba, Montu and Gwazi. Since then, I've also returned to ride the awesome drop coaster Sheikra, which is probably now my favourite ride in the park as I love that drop sensation.\n\nThere are also gentler rides and I love Rhino Rally, which is a cross between a safari jeep ride and..... SPOILER ALERT...... a section where the jeep is swept away down a river by a flash flood. Great fun.\n\nBesides the rides, there's also an interesting zoo, which is well worth a visit as well as shows. It's a nice family park but with some big rides to interest coaster addicts like me.",

There are about 2 dozen kangaroos and wallabies  in a sliver of the park with no grass or space to rome.  Maybe two of them were standing up.  We just told ourselves that they had a big space in the back for frolicking.  This is a common problem for us when we go out to zoos and similar places.  Busch Gardens seemed like it was a safe bet with the funding that they have so we were shocked when we saw it. They charge $7 for beers that the company makes for ten cents so you would think that they could get the kangaroos some grass and not charge people $5 for a hand full of food pellets.",

I'm there! \n\nUp until X opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain, Montu had been my favorite roller coaster of all time. It's such a smooth ride. As many have pointed out, ones like Gwazi aren't as smooth. \n\nIf it's still the same, they've got a tent where you can get free samples Busch beverages: spanning from Bud to O'Doul's. I was underage at the time, but not being much of a fan of Busch's drinks these days, I don't think I was missing out. \n\nThe zoo aspect was OK, but I remember there weren't many animals out on the summer day we were there. Since hoof-and-mouth disease was a concern at the time, they frequently made patrons wipe their feet before getting on certain attractions. \n\nOverall I liked Busch Gardens more than Disney's Animal Kingdom, specifically when it came to rides and how many animals we saw.",

I'm very excited, since I've ridden every roller coaster here growing up and I'd like to just relax here with my cousins while my nieces and nephews ride a few rides. We go to the Crown pub, which is supposed to have a large selection of craft beer--it's closed. The \"craft beer\" on tap is a holiday Sam Adams, shock top and bud light--your typical shit bar selection. The \"craft beer\" at the area near Falcons fury are all big brand name hoppy IPAs on tap, but barely what I'd call a selection. No porters, no Browns, no ambers and no stouts. Anywhere. Not even a Guinness in sight. In the entire park. This park is owned by a beer company that was bought by a beer company, and somehow mucked it up. They got rid of its free beer option in favor of more expensive tickets, two or three new rides that aren't nearly as fun as the old rides, and a fast pass option that you have to buy if you don't want to sit in line for two hours, because fast pass customers can ride twice in front of you, get in line again and keep you waiting. It's dark now and I've barely been on two rides, I got here at 11. Everything about the new park sucks, including their $9 bud lights. Count me out, Busch Gardens. This'll be my last trip here, I'll try to keep my family away from this horrible place, and I won't be recommending it to anyone visiting me either.",

On of the park employees told us said they were only expecting 5000 people and the weather was beautiful. \n\nThere is really something for everyone here - very thrilling roller coasters (maybe 6 of them - not sure because we didn't ride them).   A good third of the park is a big open park area with all the usual zoo animals.  The grounds are very well kept snd it seems to be a pretty decent setting for the animals.

Two times I got the prize exactly in the claws and yet it let it go....absolutely asinine ...if your going to do rigged games then put more carnival games rather then stupid claw machines or increase claw strength .

      "text": "We stopped in on a cool Friday. We were hoping there would not be a ton of people here since spring break was over. We paid our $20 for parking (ouch) and were flagged down to parking lot C. Easy parking and polite attendants. Some people were driving all over the place being super picky about where they parked but given it was a high of 70 it did not really matter where we parked. \n\nWalked up to the shuttle and it took us straight to the front doors. Our tickets were marked Gate C so off we went. Walked through the metal detector and zapped our tickets and in we went. \n\nThere were maps of the park so we grabbed one and we took the left avenue for our day's adventure. Most people were going right so we figured why fight the crowds and go the other direction. \n\nSome of the restaurants were not open yet (11 AM) weird so we had to walk a ways until we located a place that was open. We opted for the BBQ place which turned out to be very good. \n\nWalked throughout the park all day and left by 6 pm. It was a great day. Not too busy and the weather could not have been any better.",

They really took a long time in the heat and everything to spend time with all the kids. \n\nOn to the rest of the park, I love roller coasters and this place has plenty of them. Unfortunately I didn't ride any, I had a serious headache from a sinus infection, but the ride looked totally awesome. \n\nThe one great thing we did was ride the Train ride around the park. \n\nI think the one thing I was not into was the lack of merchandising, the lack of things to look through was ridiculous. \n\nOther than that I loved Busch Gardens and would definitely go back.",

      "text": "it was a very nice visit, at least it started like that. We went there and bought 3 visits entrance, by 4 adults and 2 kids. It was a nice experience, the train,Xmass events were all nice...until we decided to eat something to continue our experience..\n\nwe stopped by Zagora Cafe and bought burgers and chicken nuggets (kid's menu), and guess what happened? immediately after trying a french fry, I noticed a taste difference. Later I tasted all of our fries (6 menu totally), and they were tasting the same..for burgers, it was not that good at all. but the terrible parts started when chicken nuggets were eaten by our kids. They did not even  finished them, just 1 little part each of then..and now, both of them are throwing up, still, and food-poissoned. \n\nMy brother in law also threw up on the road back to Orlando. He said he tried one of the nuggets, that is why he strongly threw up. We did take care of the kids, and now it is 6.43am in the morning, I will go to hospital because I now suspect that this place may have GI INFECTION, and everybody can be sick after eating there. I am working in the medical field more than 10 years now, and I am expert about infections. I am pretty sure that this place is spreading viruses and bacterias. \n\nstay away from this place, if you are willing to save your kids' lives. Just a note, if your kid is 2 years old or smaller, then it can be life-dangerous to get such an infection. ALso note that this does not mean it will be easy to handle the infection after they are 3 years old. EVen my brother in law (more than 34 yo), it is quite difficult to handle the infection. \n\nstay away! I am going to take also an action against these people who are not putting efforts for the hygiene. They dont respect people..they dont respect people's lives.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens used to be one of my favorite amusement parks in Florida. With that being said my experience with them this past weekend altered my opinion. It was my boyfriend's first time attending and I was excited to show him some of my favorite rides at the park.Unfortunately that wasn't possible because the majority of the rides were experiencing technical difficulties and none of the workers were able to tell us an estimated time. \n\nInitially we went to Cheetah Hunt and the \"estimated wait time\" was 10 minutes. As we were next in line to get on the ride they announced that they were having technical difficulties and since we were so close to getting on, we decided to wait. In total the wait time was 30 minutes which we didn't mind at first since it was only our first ride. Afterwards, we walked over to Falcon's Fury. The estimated wait time was 10 minutes as well but as we are waiting in line they announced that they were having technical difficulties and none of the workers could give us information about what was going on or how long it would take so we decided to go to another ride meanwhile. We ended up going on Scorpion and afterwards Falcon's Fury was working so we decided to do the line once again and we finally got to go on it. We hoped that it wouldn't happen again but our luck fell short. We walked over to Sheikra and the workers rudely told us that the ride was closed due to technical difficulties so we couldn't go in. That is when we got frustrated because Sheikra is the most popular ride which I was excited to get on and it wasn't possible. We tried to stay positive and we remembered that we had yet to go on Montu. So we walked to Montu and once again the worker tells us that they are experiencing difficulties and they wouldn't know how long it might take. Right after that we just decided to leave the park. \n\nThe whole experience was unpleasant, and quite frankly I feel like I wasted my time and money.",

      "text": "Buy the All Day Dining Plan, even if you only eat one meal here. \nRead more about it at the bottom of my review.\nCame on July 5th. Arrived at 9am. parked slowly filled up through the day. By 1 or 2 pm we started feeling the press of people. All the staff, including the food service staff was very friendly. \nWe ate at three different restaurants, Colony House, Zambia Smokehouse and the Desert Grill. Unlike a lot of parks, the food at each restaurant was good. Not OMG Great! but good - much better than I expected. Each place offers a different dining atmosphere. \nZambia Smokehouse - says it has A/C. If they did it wasn't working. \nDesert Grill - Great A/C! Large open area with picnic tables lined up in front of a stage. We escaped to here when the rain came.\nColony House - This has the best view. You can look out onto the grazing range and watch the Giraffes, zebras...etc. Good A/C and it has a full bar.\nFor the most part they are pretty effficient at moving people through ride lines, but it is what it is. They tout that the Cheetah rollercoaster can move almost 1400 people an hour. The line does move quick. \nThe Montu coaster (in the Egypt area) is hard to get to because of the inefficient way the park is laid out, but it is well worth it. It is my favorite coaster in the park.\nThe log flume ride is one of the longest waits - tight, cramped line and hot. Not worth the wait if you ask me. \nI think the MOST IMPRESSIVE part of this park is their animal exhibits. I'm not a big fan of zoos but I have to say I am impressed with the focus on the the animals and the habitats they have for them. It is obvious they love and care for their animals as well as the best of zoos. DO NOT PASS UP the opportunity to take in any of the \"animal closeups\" where the keepers come out and tell you intimate details about their animals. Not just information about the species but about the animals, their names and their individual personalities. The Elephants, Cheetahs, tiger and ape exhibits offer multiple points of view of the animals. \n\nThe bad. The layout of the park. There is no shortcut through the middle of the park. You do A LOT of walking. The Egyptian area where the MONTU coaster is (about the only thing there really) is more or less a spur off the main park loop. \n\nALL DAY DINING.\nFor an extra $10 dollars a ticket you eat free as much as you want at all the major restaurants in the park AND HALF PRICE at all other food vendors in the park. When water is $2.50 a bottle, you save quick. For 4 us us, we spent maybe an extra $20 on food-drink and that was out of convenience. We could have spent less. BEER IS HALF PRICE TOO. We paid $6.00 for two 20oz. beers intead of $12.",

      "text": "Go with someone who is local and knows the place otherwise you might waste time not knowing where to go. When we started, we went to the left and everything was closed except the kangaroo and bird sanctuary. Rides, all the food places were shut down and it was frustrating because they didn't have any signs or people informing you what was open and what was closed in the front. The map gives you a layout, but the signs are poorly placed; hence why you want to go with someone who knows where the rides are. I'd recommend going when they open to ensure you can get through everything because we got there around 1 pm and we missed a couple of the rides at the very end. During the spring, they only stay open until 7 pm and when it's 7, they are extremely quick about shutting everything down and pushing you out the door. They do leave all the shops at the very front open for last minute purchases.\n\nMy son and I were waiting in line for cobra's curse and the rest of my group took off to ride the Montu roller coaster. We were waiting in line for a good 30 minutes and after the first 20 we stopped moving. No announcement made but slowly people started coming from the front of the line and walking out. After a few more minutes, more people started leaving so we just took off with this group. The ride stopped for some reason but they never announced it to all the people standing in line. The other group was able to get through the Montu twice and I went with my other son again on that in less than five minutes.\n\nWe walked over to the Falcon's Fury and a couple went to get in line for that ride. They were at the front after 20 minutes and they closed that ride. It wasn't until 30 minutes later we noticed it back up and running again... a little concerning when they have to shut rides down.\n\nIt's definitely not clean, but can be enjoyable with less crowds and more affordable if you want to ride roller coasters. They have a couple water rides, which are in the back of the park. There is a safari ride, I don't know if that cost more money and a train ride which would be nice if you want a small break from walking around the park. They do have several animals throughout the park you can stop and watch (Kangaroos, birds, alligators, penguins, elephants, cheetahs, and more in the Safari section). The the number of kangaroos they had, it looked miserable in the small space. Maybe there is a larger habitat they get to roam after hours...\n\nIf you live there it's worth the extra to purchase the annual pass. It makes no sense to purchase a one day because of the price different.",

Getting in the park was a pain.  it had scanners that were self service that took forever.  There were 25 people in front of us and it took about 30 mins to get in.  This is why it only gets 4 stars not five because of the worst front gate of any park i have ever been to.  Once in though it was great.  The lines for the ride were really long so we paid the extra money to get the quick passes.  It is well worth it if it is a busy day and you only have half a day to do the park.  The park has several really good coasters and then others that are ok.  I would still recommend you do them all at least once.  The train is a must do to see all of the animals.

I love animals and I have always wanted to go to this location.  Now here is the issue, I am on the busty side and we read all the weight and size information on the rides and everything before we waited in lines. \nWe get to one of the rides and read the measurements and my husband and I were both in the clear. After we waited for under a half hour (which isn't bad at all) it is our turn to get on the ride.  My husband and I sit in the seats and we don't fit. ANYWHERE.  We went into the larger lines (4 and 5) just to be on the safe side. \nI actually had to have 2 people push down on the harness to get it clipped and it still didn't actually clip well.  They said that is ok but I couldn't breathe.  I was so uncomfortable and had to get out!  I was so embarrassed because they kept wanting to try. I finally got of the ride and walked away mortified and crying.  I understand they were trying to help but when I say I am done then that means don't try anymore.  I have never been that embarrassed before in my life.  \nThe other good thing that came out of this day was that the weather was perfect.  Most of the animals were out yet a lot of them were sleeping.  I did get a lot of good pictures and the park really wasn't that packed so that was an added bonus.  Of course I will come back to this location but because of the prices and the fact that we couldn't get on the rides, it won't be any time soon.",

That can happen but it caused an extra 45 minutes wait time. Then while waiting for montu the ride was stopped to retrieve items that customers dropped! This is unacceptable! There are many signs warning you not to bring loose items on the ride. Are people dumb? If this is your policy then don't bother putting signs up saying not responsible for lost items. Those items being retrieved added another 35 minutes to the wait time. The other ride that stopped for a good portion of the day was the sky ride. Again we were disappointed.

We spend our first two hours here in line for rides that stopped working when we were almost to the front and spent 45 min already in line. Then we rode the Seikra and it stopped and we were stuck on it! Spent about 25 min in the blazing sun at a 90 degree angle as an alarm was sounding, which really doesn't help the atmosphere up there. My brother was crying and my mom and I were about ready to have a panic attack. All we got out of this was ONE fast pass. The managers and park really didn't care. We looked up the Sheikra online later and this seems to happen a lot, maybe they need to take better care of their park. Pretty sketchy - especially since multiple rides had to close for malfunctions. \nThe park is somewhat hard to navigate and it's hard to find all the animals because of how poor it's set up. But the animals are interesting to look at, but might as well just go to the zoo since they're probably treated better. \nThen it started pouring and everything was shut down, they didn't even keep open the animal pavilion so everyone had absolutely nothing to do and they don't have any sort of compensating weather policy so if you do come, come when there's for sure no rain\nWe were planning on finding a manager to discuss these issues and how disappointing it was to spend $700 on a crappy day. But by the end of the day we were so sick of it and done we just went home.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens Tampa earned a new level of respect from my last visit last November - see, I had always looked upon it as a theme park not quite themed as well as its sibling in Williamsburg, VA, but not quite as lowly as say, a run-of-the-mill amusement park.  However, as I exited the skyway ride, we came upon a covered area that detailed the history of the park, through the years (I am always a sucker for retro stuff) which showed its progression and changes - bascially, the park it is today is a result of changing attitudes, tourist cycles and ownership - it's almost like an evolutionary canvas that is yet to be complete.\n\nWhile that might sound new-agey and weird, it did give me a better understanding and made me look beyond the sometimes forced-feeling as you pass from the different 'African' themes in the park.  I had never realized how old the park was, and when I learned that, it actually made me appreciate it a lot more.\n\nSure, most visitors are going to just sprint past the smaller details en route to Sheikra (which is pretty neat in itself) - if you have the time and patience to really tour the park, you'll see the love that's in the construction and landscaping...I mean, I had thought of the giant Plantation house as ostentascious, but when I looked further into its history, it didn't seem quite so random!\n\nAs other area attractions go, don't be disuaded by nonchalant theme park workers - they're good and bad ones, all not paid enough to do the hard work they have to do - and just go and enjoy!",

It goes on forever but you still don't want it to stop.\nMontu-this is one of the most intense B&M inverts out there.

      "text": "Coasters!!!! This is the best park I have been to if you want to hit up awesome coaster after awesome coaster. \n\nSheiKra is AHHHHmazing! The most thrilling, terrifying, awesome coaster ever. When you are ascending to the drop you are literrally looking up at the sky. The climb is a 47-degree 200-foot lift hill but it feels like 80-degrees. The train then makes a U-turn and approaches the holding brake, which suspends the train for about 6 seconds at 90-degrees... it's crazy!!! And it def feels more than 6 seconds. \n\nCheetah Hunt is the newest of coasters and is okay. Not my favorite. \n\nMontu was my favorite, so smooth and floor less. You get to enjoy the excitement in its entirety because it's not jerky in the least. Love it!!!\n\nSkyride is a nice relaxing ride that taps you along the sky of the park so you get a nice bird's eye view of all surroundings. \n\nRhino Rally has gone down hill. I feel like the tour guides take it a little too far with the jokes and are basically laughing at how lame the ride it. I used to like it but they made it a bit smaller due to some construction. \n\nSandSerpent is a kid roller coaster but Oh. My. Word. We felt like we were going to go over the edge at any moment. It definitely has the feel of a boardwalk coaster and going from being secured in shoulder straps to a lap bar, it's just a little frightening. Nice adrenaline rush though!\n\nOh, and they have Woodchuck on tap in the pub, Done!",

I know it may not compare to the top 10 coasters you see on the travel channel and stuff, but I don't like those crazy rides all the time, so the roller coasters here are a nice ride. So what do I love about Busch Gardens...1. They have animals and coasters. 2. They have howl o scream 3.Their prices are reasonable. \n\n1. I like the fact that I can see animals and ride rides for one price. The animals you may find include alligators, flamingos, primates, cheetahs, tigers, rhinos, hippos(I think) and giraffes. They also have a cool bird area where you can feed these pretty colorful birds, I forgot their names. My favorite rides are cheetah hunt and sheikra. They also have an ice skating show, but I never have time to watch it.\n\n2. Howl o scream is their Halloween themed nights. There are zombies walking around, people hiding trying to scare you, and haunted houses. I hate hunted houses...I scream and laugh with my eyes closed the entire time. I hate things popping out even though I know its not real. I don't know why I even torture myself with them. You can also ride the rides during howl o scream and there are discounted prices on certain nights. It's really fun.\n\n3. You can pay less than $100 and get in the rest of the year free. have you been to Disney or Universal lately? If you have, you know that less than $100 for a year pass is GREAT!\n\nBTW: Parking is around $17",

      "text": "From the POV of a tourist / parent of two girls, ages 7 & 8: we had a *great* day at Busch Gardens.\n\nJungala was a BIG hit with my kids. They easily spent 2.5 hours climbing around. They rode the treetop zip line gliders a dozen times. And the animal experiences in this area are *amazing*: Get face-to-face - literally - with a tiger, just inches away behind a thick plate of glass. Ditto for a gharial (like a crocodile), flying foxes (huge bats), gibbons. Really, really cool.\n\nTIP: if it's hot and you have kids, have them wear bathing suits under their clothes. There are two water play areas in Jungala - one for tots and one for older kids.\n\nThe park was really quiet overall, especially (I have to guess) for spring break. Granted, we weren't going on big rollercoasters, but our longest wait for anything was under 10 minutes. Many things we just walked right on. My advice would be to arrive later (10-11ish) and stay til close. Ride operators indicated that the crush of \"Orlando people\" tend to come at open and leave by 4. There was literally \" -0- minutes wait\" for even the big roller coasters toward the end of the day.\n\nOTHER TIP: Safari experiences cost extra, and they didn't look worth it. After having spent $300 on admissions & parking, we were not interested in dropping another $50 on a jeep ride. No one in our party had a lesser time because of it. We felt we got good peeks at the \"Serengeti\" animals via the skyride & train.\n\nOnly downside was that the entrance to each \"land\" is not super-obvious, and the wayfinding leaves a bit to be desired. Pay good attention to your park map, or you could really miss a lot or waste tons of time seeking out bathrooms.\n\nGreat overall. Clean, well maintained, beautiful greenery & lots of shade, Jungala area fills the bill for ages 6-10. Yay, BG!\n\nPS: Yeah, brewery appears to be gone, and your no-longer-free Bud will cost you $7. The Clydesdales are still there, though, which are the only bits of the Busch legacy that my family was interested in.",

We drove 7 hours down I-75 from Atlanta to visit Busch Gardens. The drive was worth it. We had a great time, mostly riding coasters, but we did get to see some animals.\n\nI love the roller coasters. Sheikra was my favorite. Then Cheetah Hunt, along with Gwazi. Montu made me and my friends nausea. We didn't get to ride Kumba and Scorpion. Kumba was closed and Scorpion didn't have the quick queve and the line was long. We did Rhino Rally and that was cool. I was a little disappointed that it was very short.\n\nSpeaking of Quick Queve, Quick Queve is something I would purchase, you can bypass the lines with it. Also get the food special deal, or diner deal (what ever they call it) you can go inside the restaurant and get whatever you want, and you could always go back to get more food. Quick Queve will come in handy for Cheetah Hunt. When we went back in February, the lines were very long.\n\nAlso the reason I like Gwazi was that was the first ride we rode, because it was the closest to the entrance. It wasn't the painful bumps you have on some wooden coasters. So ride this one first.\n\nFinally, don't ride the river rapids during the winter time. We went in February and it was breezy and 65 degrees. So the water was freezing. So the lowest temperature, that is good to ride the rapids would be 75 degrees. \n\nThat's about. Busch Gardens is a must place to visit in the Tampa area. So have fun and enjoy Busch Gardens like we did. I hope to return to Busch Gardens again very soon.",

I love you because you are not afraid to shake up or scare your guests\nThe Howl O Scream is so much scarier than Universal it is scary.  The roller coasters are fantastic unlike the wimpy things at Disney and the few somewhat anemic ones at Universal.  And they serve beer and liquor all over.\n\n2. I love you because there are no cutsy singing animals.  \nYou have real lions, and tigers, and well no bears but almost.  And I stared one in the eye and it tried to eat me.  Awesomeness!  And don't worry, there was a fence in the way.  Now the rhinos chasing the train is another story.\n\n3.  I love you because of the free concerts.\nAnd they get some good bands too.  Real classic rock banks like Lynard Skynard (sorry for the spelling if it is wrong) are there all the time.  And did I mention that they don't cost any more?\n\n4. I love you for being reasonably priced.  \nUnlike any other amusement park, I can get an anual pass for a reasonable price.  As a local it makes sense because I get discounts of food, beer, booze, souvineers, and get in any time I want.  When going to the Park to drink and look at the African Savannah costs me less than going to Ybor or Hyde Park, they are definately doing something right.\n\n5.  I love you because of the coasters.\nDid I mention that they are not afraid to shake you up?  The coasters are awesome.  Even the wooden one will make you want to kiss the ground and then hop back on for another ride.  And frankly the only one I don't love is the new Cheetah Hunt.  It is BORING since it is long and fast with few turns, drops, or loops.  \n\nReally it is hard not to like.  It lacks the polish of Disney and Universal but that is actually what makes it fun.  It is not antiseptic like other places.  This is real and raw and, well, fun.\n\nI had an annual pass last year.  I will get another this year.  I think that it is money well spent.",

I like that you can walk around drinking a beer. \n\nSpeaking of beer, I would also suggest signing up early for the beer tasting class offered. This caps out later in the day and you usually have to sign up on session in advance, but free beer! Also, at the main hub you can get 2 free mini beers.

Just a great day last Friday s I chaperoned a field trip. Great new rides and a zoo that would rival big city, stand alone zoos. I went for free since I was a chaperone, but I believe the prices for admission were pretty competitive for the Florida theme park extravaganza. Food is expensive. Water, soft drinks and adult beverages are expensive as well. Just had a great day at Busch Gardens!!",

Addionally are the most railroad crossing closed,too! So we can't get easy to the remaining attractions like the hippos. Because that problem we can't see the meet the keepers of the hippos! Because that things all together,I'm really very very angry about that and really disappointed about the whole park and service for the visitors! The maintenance and addionally build up pf the park is very great,but not with this service and on that way! Why must I pay the whole price and get the half of attractions and don't have fun at the moment! Can I get my money back, to invest in better things?!\nI hope you invest my money for the animals! For the great reserve for the animals to live,you get the two stars!",

Yes the price of admission is a tad high. Yes the food options are not comparable to Disney World. But, if you can look past all that this park is incredible! The animals are amazing (especially the hyena). The vegetation throughout the park really gave a zoo-like feel. The Cheetah Hunt coaster was by far our favorite ride. I appreciated how convenient the locker rentals were as well as the cubby holes placed near the rides. My boyfriend and I decided to ride the Falcon Fury ride (for the first time). IT IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. Falcon Fury was probably the scariest yet most exciting thrill ride I have ever been on. Don't forget to stop by the gift shops for cute souvenirs (appropriately priced). Definitely would go back!!!! Hopefully it won't be as hot outside this time.",

The park opens at 10 AM and you have to go through bag check prior to entering the park. Given that the lines are terribly long and the bag checkers aren't the fastest (In fact the bag check her in our line continuingly joked and converse with the people ahead of us delaying our entry even longer). That leaves you exactly 15 minutes to go through baggage check, go through the ticket line, and also get to the check-in station in the middle of the park. We arrived three minutes ahead of The 1030 deadline only to learn that the tour left early prior to 1030 and we would not be able to participate in the tour. The check in person refuse to contact the tour guide althoughThe other check in people volunteer to walk us over to the elephant area. After 10 minutes of prodding, he finally called her and by then she refused.\n\nVery disappointing, given that the other insider tors also state that the check-in is 15 minutes prior and the other tour guides were willing to wait for the other participants until they arrive and also the tour started after their designated start time\n\nIf you can imagine that you are there for vacation, are only there for one day and this is your only opportunity to complete the tour, it's the first tour of the day and you only have 15 minutes to get from the entrance to the middle of the park and find your way there, it's pretty frustrating when the tour leaves early and they are not willing to accommodate you given that it's their fault that they left early.\n\nWhen the tour guide arrive to approve the refund, she didn't not even acknowledge my presence.",

      "text": "This will contain both negative and positive points of my visit but I will deal with the negative first!! \n\nI returned to Busch Gardens after visiting around a year ago with my wife. When I was here in 2015, I LOVED IT and would rave to everyone about how much there is to do at Busch Gardens for an amazing day out. \n\nI was there the other day and I was totally underwhelmed. The staff at the rides do not even entertain a 'Good Morning' or a 'Thank you'...simply the standard \"How Many?\" question and a finger pointing to where they would like you to stand. I'm not at the park for a friendly face, don't get me wrong, but it really helps. I heard many people comment about how rude some employees are. \n\nSpeaking of the attractions - many of the attractions were closed and up until around 2pm (I was there at 10am) I could swear I was walking around a closed park. In fact, it wasn't until around 4pm that Sheikra opened. However it seemed that the closed Falcons Fury to counter balance this. I will say though that many of the roller coasters do look like they are in dire need of a refurb.\n\nSome of the cafes were closed, most of the concession stands were covered and not in operation and even the stores which were open didn't seem to be properly staffed. We had to wander around and look for a member of staff to ring through our soft drinks\n\nPrices seem to have soared for things like food and drink, and also the Serengeti Safari etc. I was disappointed as I was looking forward to this. \n\nFinally, I was a little taken aback to see that one of the hyenas looked pretty injured on its back which had left a huge scab. I didn't expect to see this and it stuck with me. \n\nAND NOW THE POSITIVE!\n\nThe park does still have some redeeming qualities, the roller coasters are still fun, the animal viewing areas are excellent and diverse. I especially love the tiger viewing window that lets you put your head inside the tiger enclosure. I was lucky today that one of the tigers chose to fall asleep right at this window and I felt really close. It was amazing. \n\nThe Ice Skating show was fantastic and thrilling, with different scenes, scents and interactive weather effects as a part of the show such as snow and bubbles etc. It also had beautiful animals as part of the stage show Luke huskies and exotic birds. \n\nLastly, the gorilla enclosure is always a treat. Especially with the little baby they have right now! \n\nAll in all, I would say the day was fine.",

Since it had a been a few years since my last visit,  I studied their website and watch videos of the rides on youtube. For what it costs to play for the day, there is no way I am going to be unprepared. This was probably the 50th time I have been to the park, I kid you not. I was impressed with everything. Being a Floridian, I checked the weather and saw scattered rain but decided to give it a shot...I was pretty pumped after watching Falcons Fury lol. It was the perfect day! Little to no sweating and plenty of cloud cover. Granted they did stop a few rides but some ran in the rain which was fun. It wasn't pouring of course so it was still safe. The only ride we didn't get on was the Kumba, everytime we went by it was down:( Besides that we had a blast and I can't wait to go back. I do wish the decent food was a little cheaper. We ate at the Smoke House and split their biggest plate. We also were reminded that they close at six so reluctantly headed to the gate only to find that the cafe was still in full swing! We warmed up with a cup of Starbucks Coffee and shared a slice of chocolate truffle cake. Coffee was excellent but the cake was mediocre. I loved the rides! Falcons Fury.....I can't even describe it. Scariest ride I have been on and I am def a thrill seeker. We rode that one twice. What an experience! We loved Montu and Cheetah Hunt too! What a day! We even rode the several times in a row since there were no lines! It was a Tuesday, maybe that was part of the reason. I think a lot of people gave up when it started to rain. Not us! We even went to the pet show which was a really nice break from the non stop excitement that the coasters provided. We got there promptly and 10 am when they opened and loved how they play the national anthem before they open the gate too! The weather can be tricky sometimes you sweat like a pig of get rained on. I have a blast either way but was definitely feeling favored by the theme park God's on that day. #luckylady #flogrown #rideordie I have been to all of the theme parks in Florida. I have had year passes or more to each at different times. BG is by far the best value for the money! Dying to go back!",

The \"Sheikra\", with a 90 degree fall, is absolutely frightening.\ni also love the animals they have ( tigers, crocodiles...)\n\nIt REALLY is a nice place to visit with a group of friends or with family members. You'll definitely have a lot of fun.\n\nI suggest you get the \"fast pass\" .The regular line lasts about 90 min. With the pass you get ahead of the line and it takes you only about 10 min.",

      "text": "I like Busch Gardens, it's just that I remember it being a bit funner. I've been going since i was 3 years old, and I still think it's fun, I just think they really need to take a while and remodel. Repaint everything, redo rides, redo restaurants.. Lots of stuff. The people that go here are quiet rude too. The staff is OK depending on what day you're going on. I have an annual pass, but it feels like it's almost always in construction or in the middle of being redone? Well I know they're improving it, and adding new stuff, so I'll give them a break.\n\nGood place to go if you love roller coasters or you're bringing a child. \n\nThe children's area is great, and it's great for adults, but if you're under 21 (yet over 10) years old and doesn't like rollar coasters, then I don't think there's much to do..\n\nBasically, if you have the money/time to go to Disney World rather then Busch Gardens, then I highly recommend doing so.",

I was able to get myself and family free tickets for being in the military. The restaurants were great; especially the bbq one. That was our fav! I think the best ride there in our opinion was the Sheikra. Talk about thrilling. I think my stomach was still in my throat when we hit the second dive. While I did not get on the cheetah, it does seem like an amazing ride. At first glance it doesn't seem like much but once you see it on the map you see just how much thought was put into. The engineering behind that is simply amazing! Will definitely go back.",

Since we had our little one with us, we only went on one roller-coaster ride- I can't remember the name but it was awesome!\n\nI'm a Six Flags kind of guy, but Busch Gardens is was better for families with infants/toddlers.  The train that went through the park and highlighted the animals was great!  Giraffes, rhinos, gazelle, tigers, elephants, bald eagle- we saw them all!  We also got to feed the flamingos! \n\nI had purchased the Tampa City Pass and we got 5 attractions for $100, which is not bad.\n\nMy one criticism is the wait in line to get out city pass changed into a park pass took forever.  They need younger people working the computers because Danny took forever!  All in all though, it was a super experience!",

      "text": "Let me first say we were in desperate need of a vacation as my daughter is eleven and never been on a vacation... Sad I know!!!! Busch gardens was out first venture out that week. Thinking it would not take much to impress us and surely we would have a blast. I was seriously disappointed and sick I had spent money that was not easy to come by on a day at Busch gardens. Let me start with the good things. The employees were super friendly and eager to help. The ones who were spraying water on customers who asked were upbeat and kind. That was  unique as so many employees in today's society as well as those over the company are not affected by customers who aren't satisfied. Busch gardens defintely nailed the customer service department and gets a A+!! Secondly, the animals were awesome to watch and as close to being in a natural habitat as possible. I liked that they were not being trained and were roaming free for visitors to watch. Loved loved the gorilla family. Third, OUR VERY FAVORITE PART WAS the shridesat included dogs, cats, birds, pony, and a pig. As one who has worked animal rescue for years I thought I would not like the show. Because after all animals are just that. However I was really impressed by the love and affection shown for the animals. With rescue it is almost impossible not to domesticate an animal. Anyone who says different isn't being honest. As announced during show, all of their animals have been rescued. They seem to live the life of luxury. That said I did have one issue with the animals. I noticed all animals constantly received treats through the show.. Anyone who owns a animal knows they will get tired of their treats if given too much. This had me wondering how they continued to use treats to get them to do what they wanted. Looking closer I watched the cats after they performed their act, such as running on a high rope etc... At the end of each act was a small silver bowl filled with something that EACH cat INHALED as if they were starving. They ate it so fast it seemed they were swallowing whole and would choke. That concerned me making me ask if they were making sure the cats were really really hungry so they would perform. I did ask trainer's what cats were eating and was told hot dogs. My sister has two cats and says her cats lap up hot dogs as if they have not eaten in a while but did admit not to that level. Even after seeing this I will still say they really acted as they are loved and are very happy. I will give the treatment of the animals a 10 after taking all I saw into consideration. I loved that they stressed the importance of adopting from a shelter versus buying a dog or cat. Now to what I didn't like. If I would have had a really young child I could have entertained on the tree house which and sprinkler area. If a 17 year old entertainment could be found on the rides. If they are into that kind of thing. However my eleven year old who is terrified of rides was only entertained for the thirty minutes we were in the show. She wanted so much to do the safari visit and have a up close visit with the giraffes but sadly had to tell her no as there was an extra charge for this part. Busch Gardens definitely has the right idea but I feel has many gaps to fill. We walked a lot to get one place or other and upon arrival at our location there was a huge wait. Surely their must be something they could do to fill in the gaps in between the areas. I would not recommend this to someone who doesn't ride rides. After all I could see the same animals at the zoo.... But again let me stress if you are like me and believe in awesome customer support you won't find a place any better in this area.",

We attempted to wait in three different lines and we were unable to actually get on any rides because the rides broke down before we could get on them! There was one ride that didn't break down, however we couldn't ride it because you had to store  belongings in order to ride and all the lockers were sold out. We found the staff to be very rude for the most part. We successfully canceled our annual passes. Customer service offered no apology and didn't even ask why we were cancelling. They must be used to dissatisfaction. The worst part is that my 10 year old and 4 year old were terribly disappointed at having not gone on a single ride. Won't  be back.",

      "text": "Ahh Busch Gardens. It has been years since I've been here. I don't even remember it as a child, besides the fact that it was very fun and had a lot of roller coasters. I had such a great time here. The great thing about Busch Gardens is that it is not in Orlando. What does that mean? Way less people. We went on a Saturday and we opted to not buy the fast pass in the front. We arrived when I opened and decided to feel it out to see whether the lines would get long. Overall, we barely had to wait. The longest wait was 45 minutes and that was only for one ride. The rest were all 10, 15, 20 minutes.\nI love that the park is separated into different countries and has all the animals. If you take the train you can see many of the animals on the plain-giraffes, rhinos, gazelles, wildebeest etc. You can add an additional tour for extra and fed the giraffes and see the animals up close.\nThe park has very fun roller coasters. Sheikra is he one where you can drop at 90 degree angle. Falcon's fury you drop also and it tilts your body forward to give you that feeling of actually falling forward which is an intense adrenaline rush.\nIn the area called Pantopia you can see and feed the kangaroos which we were able to do. There are several restaurants and food stops along the way where you can buy food. Everything is overpriced, but that is definitely to be expected.\nWe were there from opening to closing!\nWould 100% come back here again!",

      "text": "We took our daughters 18 and 15 there for MLK holiday from school.  We live 2 hours away.  They have season passes to Universal but love Busch the best for the roller coasters. They rode them all and said they loved them - their only complaint (and that was mild) is the wait time for some rides.  Most were only 15 minutes or so but the Cheetah coaster wait was 90 mins (it would've been 15 mins shorter but it broke down so they had to wait through that). They convinced me (and I don't do roller coasters) to go on the Montu.  It was my 18 yo's bday so I had to give in.  Scared the living day lights out of me.  But it was kinda fun too.  It is said to be one of the world's longest inverted rides.  You go upside down through 3 loops.  I survived.  My husband and I mostly like the animals which is another great thing about Busch Gardens. Kids get to do what they want and there's still something for us oldsters.  There was a great cheetah demo where we got to watch one of the young cheetah's chase some bait along with her \"brother\" which is a dog!  Also a MUST see is the Cast-a-way Critters show.  We saw it and then had our daughters meet us for another one.  The animal trainers have taken pets from shelters along with some exotic animals and trained them in an amazing way!  Absolutely amazing.  And cute.  And fun. There's even an opp at the end to pet an owl and the other animals.  I love the way the zoo part of the park is.  If I were an animal, I'd want to live at Busch Gardens.  It is beautiful.  The animal settings are idyllic.  Other things we got to do: pet a kangaroo and a wallaby, watch the ape family and about a hundred pink flamingo, ride the train where we saw (up close) the new baby zebras, see the alligators and the funny little otters, see a replica of King Tut's tomb (very nicely done). I have read other reviews of unfriendly staff.  Didn't see that.  Staff was smiling and friendly. Except on one occasion in a cafeteria line when the oblivious and annoying teens in front of us didn't notice it was time to order because they were screwing around with their friends too much-I was all for it when she yelled \"It is time to order now!\"  Ha ha.  Hints: Definitely buy the meal pass if you are going to be there all day and if you plan on 3 meals (it makes it worth it and very convenient for not having to pull out money or the credit card every time you want to eat or drink).  Wear comfortable shoes that have been broken in because there is a LOT of walking.  If you don't buy the meal deal, buy the refillable fountain drink cup for 99 cent refills. Download the free app for a map - it takes you there, gps style.  Now the complaints: 1) How I hate people that don't pay attention to where they are walking! They don't seem to realize that you walk on one side if you're headed one way and walk on the other if you're headed the other way.  You don't form a huge group and take up the entire path! You don't walk backward while talking.  So, so annoying.  2) The rides that are down all day!  We didn't get to ride the sky ride because it was shut down.  I don't know why.  And I love the sky ride.  3) The food wasn't that great.  The hamburgers tasted like fish and you don't get the choice of onion on your burger.  Everything was just so-so otherwise.  We ate at Zygora Cafe twice and Bengal Bistro.  I think they're run by the same company.  Don't get the burger.  The cheesecake was great.  The orange slices kind of dried out.  The chicken and fish strips overcooked. A meal will cost you about $12 with a drink.  That's the adult price.  That's without a side - just the platter and a drink.  4) Shopping is probably best not done there.  It is expensive and for some of the same things you could get at the Walgreens down the street.  Yes, local Walgreens and CVS usually carry the themed t-shirts, sweat shirts that they sell at the parks.  Much cheaper.  For example, a Busch Gardens sweat shirt is $60.  I guess if you're a tourist and you want a remembrance, that's ok.  But for me, I wouldn't pay that much when you could get the same thing without the logo for $30 or $40.  All and all, Busch Gardens is a good deal for the money and a great family park.  There are designated smoking areas and so you don't have to walk through second-hand smoke everywhere.  I didn't hear much cursing at all.  No make-out sessions like you sometimes see at Magic Kingdom.  Busch Gardens is a nice family park.",

I do wish there were more places spread throughout the park on the meal plan, and that they all were open the same times. \n\nOverall, busch gardens is a great place! Great value, tons to do (you need multiple days to finish everything), and tons of fun! So many great family memories made here! Thank you Busch Gardens!",

      "text": "Busch Gardens has great deals for admission. It's a great place to see some cool animals, drink beer and waste a lazy afternoon; however, if you're not a little guy, don't expect to ride the roller coasters! \nWe took advantage of their annual pass promotion, so the ticket price was fairly inexpensive. We have found their meal plan to be a great deal if you're planning to spend the entire day at the park. For about $25/person, you can enjoy unlimited food and beverages at designated restaurants and eateries.  It was worth the $25 alone just for unlimited bottles of water!\nThe animals in the park are kinda cool to see and if you're a beer drinker there's a vendor on every corner, but the shows are kinda lame - I found the pirate show to be a joke. The roller coasters are very plentiful, but they are NOT designed to fit everyone. In fact, while I looked around the park, there were MANY, MANY people who did not fit in the seats of the roller coasters - Disney needs to give them some tips on designing rides! \nThe wooden roller coaster hurt to ride - roller coasters shouldn't hurt. I had several bruises on my legs from the wooden coaster.\nOverall, I am really not impressed with Busch Gardens....but Disney on the otherhand, now there's a park!",

So after parking way the hell out in their lot and taking their crappy tram, I saw three vehicles pull up into stroller parking. I was so pissed I waited to see if it was perhaps handicapped and it wasnt. 3 families that pulled out strollers with kids who were just fine. I asked the manager who simply said they shouldn't have allowed that. So I come back the next day and same thing happened. I was beyond pissed. Then I waited 45 minutes to get through the front gate.

If it wasn't for the get an entree, drink, and dessert every hour, this place would be in the negative if it was possible. I don't know even know where to start with this place, this park is a mess! The map and signs are confusing, we've been lost multiple times throughout the day, locker directions are misleading with one sign saying 2 hours max for a day? Like what does that even mean? OHH and don't even get me started on Cheetah Hunt. If you want to read about my fun experience on the ride, find my review on the ride Cheetahs Hunt or whatever. The lines for the rides are the most atricitous/ridiculous I've been in for an amusument park. For 12 hours, I've rode a total of three rides with each ride lasting an average of about 60 seconds while I spent the majority of my time eating and waiting in line. Stay away from this park, unless you don't mind wasting your time and money waiting in lines. In my experience, the worst amusement park I've been to. Roller coasters are just cheap knock offs of other coasters, there's nothing original about their rides except for the safari tour and the tour isn't all great, because they didn't let me use the bathroom before we went and forced us to stand fpr 15 minutes throughout the tour. This park is honestly just a front for a zoo with fake stuff to fill up the park with lines that aren't worth it in the end. I mean 60 bucks for a quick queue?! Now you're just making it obvious. -50 or lower/10 would not ride again. Can't find anything good about this place so don't say I didn't warn you. This place seriously sucks A",

      "text": "My family and I went to Busch Gardens over Christmas. We got our tickets through AAA, which included a free meal one day and an extra day for free. We actually went on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, trying to gauge when it would be the least crowded. Despite the time of year, the weather was nice and definitely doable- not scorching.\n\nThe good:\n\n- Roller coasters. Sheikra and Jungala are probably the best coasters in the park. Sheikra is definitely terrifying, but the front row is worth the wait!! Same on Jungala- which was my favorite by far. It's less flashy, but definitely a very intense ride- do NOT ride it if you are prone to getting sick on rides, it is not forgiving. The Cheetah Hunt is the newest, and the longest wait. Try it to experience it, but you'll find others that are better. Walk over into Egypt and ride Montu. There is almost no wait, and it is a better coaster, though not as good as the first two.\n\n- Foliage. I know it's Busch \"Gardens\" but the entire park is LUSH. It is very well done, and if you stop to notice once in a while, you'll see carefully done scapes featuring exotic plants and some very creative displays. Overall, it's just nice to walk through an amusement park that features such opulent, well-planned and well-taken care of landscaping.\n\n- Serengeti train ride. It's awesome to see captive animals live this way and most animal attractions should feature this imo. The train ride through the park takes about 30 minutes, but the best part is riding through the open enclosure, African Serengeti plains habitat. Herds of different varieties of antelope, giraffes and even some rhino roam free in a beautifully designed exhibit. There's even a pond with some hippo, I believe, but they weren't out when we rode through. \n\nThe bad:\n\n- The zoo. The enclosures are nice, and well-planned for the most part, but I question the placement of exotic animals right next to massive roller coaster machines that do nothing but zoom around full of screaming people all day. The animals seem not to care anymore, but it doesn't seem like a calm environment. \n\nWildlife should not be thought of as a theme park attraction, and Busch Gardens isn't doing much to dispel this idea.\n\nOne thing that stuck out at me was the gorilla enclosure. It's WRONG to keep animals that share more than 97% of our DNA as captives for our viewing pleasure. Wrong. There's the argument that this is the only way people will see these animals and care about them, but these exhibits aren't educating the public about these animals. (I watched people bang on the glass walls of the enclosure like they do on the outside of a fish tank, and a girl ran up to the glass and screamed \"monkey!\") There are a few plaques on the walls with some facts about the animals that obviously no one reads. There's no biologist, no handler around to provide information. Nothing. People walk on through on their way to the next ride.\nBusch Gardens also makes a few mentions of its dedication to wildlife conservation, and while that may be true, keep in mind this is the same theme park conglomerate that owns SeaWorld. And the same corporate methodology of profiting off of captive killer whales (if you saw Blackfish), applies to profiting off of captive cheetahs, tigers, gibbons, gorillas, and so on.\n\n- The food. Busch Gardens is hands-down the WORST food experience at an amusement park I have ever had. On both days! Almost every food vendor features a cafeteria-style eatery that will take an enormous amount of time to wait through. Even with plenty of hands on deck, the staff are incredibly slow and apathetic. The food sucks obviously, it's an amusement park (!), but I would avoid the big eateries if at all possible and try to grab lunch at a stall. Better to spend your time enjoying the park you came to have fun in, than in one of its mismanaged, shitty cafeterias.",

      "text": "I spent the day at Busch Gardens last week with my mom and sister. It was a lot of fun-- the roller coasters are awesome, and the lines went pretty quickly. The park is pretty big, but walking around it did not seem so bad because there are always things to stop and do along the way. Be prepared for heat, but there are these little ice cubicles that you can go in to cool off if it becomes too much. The park's staff are super friendly and helpful. \n\nThe one big let-down was Cobra's Curse. My mom was super excited to try the new ride, so we got in line and made it almost to the front before an announcement said the ride would temporarily shut down due to \"technical difficulties\" but would be up again soon. So we waited some more, and then a new announcement said the ride was closing indefinitely, sorry. So disappointed and having wasted an hour, we left. Later in the day we came back to Cobra's Curse, and the guy said the ride was shut down due to \"technical difficulties.\" Naturally we were pretty aggravated because it's not every day we get to come to Busch Gardens-- we're from Boston for crying out loud. But anyway, at that point we didn't really want to ride a roller coaster that reportedly has all these \"difficulties.\"\n\nMy other qualm with the park is the animals. I think it's really cool that Busch Gardens is an amusement park and a zoo all together, and for the most part the enclosures were decently sized. But i wondered whether the animals were bothered or stressed by the nearby sounds of people screaming on roller coasters, particularly the gorillas and the cheetahs. (The gorillas and the chimps have a very nice area, however-- very cool and shady if you're looking for a break.) also, some of the animals seemed to be pacing unhappily, notably the white tiger, a hyena, and one of the elephants. It made me wonder about the emotional state of the animals. \n\nBecause of the Cobra's Curse let-down and questionable status of the animals, Busch Gardens did not earn 5 stars. But I would still recommend checking it out, as it's a lot of fun, no matter how old you are. I would recommend trying the Skyride at some point during the day-- it's peaceful and you get to see the animals from up above.",

There are animals in the zoo and the exhibits are well designed, but they are so spread out that it's tough to maintain a focus. \n\nThe kiddy rides are also tough for children. Size requirements mean kids can be too small for some and too big for others, with disappointment on little faces after standing in very slow lines. In fact with breakdowns and gate locking procedures by attentive operators, the lines can take almost as long as the adult rides. \n\nFinger print entry for season ticket holders is always slow and though we've learned to walk to the far end of the park after first arriving and then working our way back toward the main gate, the experience always feels a bit confusing - especially if you take in one of the scattered shows. Now that the cost of parking is approaching the cost of admission, we've decided our last visit to this park was our last.",

It's better to come when the park opens, you can hope on your favorite ride with little wait. The great thing about this theme park is the grounds. It's nice just to walk around for exercise and enjoy the landscaping and the animals. There is plenty of shade and numerous benches to sit and relax. Take an umbrella in case of rain in the summer months. The rain comes and goes. Another reason to come in the morning is that sporadic rain usually starts in the early evening. Busch Gardens is quick to shut down rides if it looks like rain.",

They have some pretty awesome animal habitats for the animal lovers and zoo goers. They got kiddie ride sections for the kiddos. They got good rides for the modest thrill seeker. And they have some epic rides for the adrenaline junkie. Mix in a fun little train ride that tours the whole park and takes you through a safari land, as well as an aerial tour ok the sky ride gondola that travels across the park. Some water rides for those hot days. And plenty of fun and games in between. Really had a blast here me and the whole family. So happy I opted for Busch gardens annual passes instead of Disney. Saved a ton of money and had a blast and still so much more haven't done, can't wait to go back for the rest of the year!!",

The rides range from ones that little kids can enjoy to huge, scary rollercoasters that adults will find fun and thrilling. The food is pricey, like with any theme park, but there are plenty of options, which is nice. If rides aren't your thing, the animals throughout the park are so wonderful to observe. You can even take a 'safari' ride and go all around the entire animal sanctuary. They have a few indoor places where they put on shows, so it's a nice time to cool down when it's hot outside. For Florida residents, if you buy a ticket for the day, it's good to use the whole rest of the year. Guaranteed to have a fun day!",

Hell, a ride I actually like, the rapids ride was 70 minutes. Absolutely not.\n\n- too much humidity. Too much walking. All you'll do is sweat which forces you to purchased overpriced theme park water bottles and food.\n\n- arcade in the park runs on tokens. Which you get TWO for a dollar. Ripped off and spent way too much trying to win stuff from the claw games.\n\n- it's cool to see some of the animals, they looked well taken care of. I was jealous of the penguins because they get to go in a pool.\n\n- they should start selling gallon jugs of water in the gift shop for a couple bucks. That way you don't run out of water so fast, and don't have to shell out too much cash for a Dasani that you'll go through in mere seconds due to the insane Florida humidity. \n\nI was pretty much done an hour into the place. At least there are cool people walking around spraying you with mists of water. \n\nIf you're into long lines and sweaty people this is the place for you!\n\nAlso, not many food options besides the few stands and the restaurant that is near the Cheetah coaster.",

My husband and I rode all the rollercoasters using the quick queue (super awesome and worth it!) and before we left the park we decided to ride Shriekra again. The concept of the ride is a roller coaster that rises to a platform at a 90 degree angle, then dangles before dropping straight down then twisting then going to a second platform and going through more twists then a tunnel and ending. What happened to us is we were going up the 90 degrees to the first platform and we were supposed to dangle and all of a sudden a super bang went off and we went so fast and everyone around me is panicking because something is obviously wrong. They were able to stop us at the second platform (which is 200 feet in the air) and we waited there for half an hour while sirens were going off and everyone is freaking out. Eventually they got us down to the bottom where they had to make a floor for us to be able to get off. It was awful and to top it off they gave us passes to re ride any ride but the park was closing and they were ushering us out. Ok? \nAnyways the park is great, the animals are cool, and the quick queue is great. You don't have to rush and you can enjoy your beer while walking around the park. The dining pass is awesome too because you get free food at the restaurants, and at the vendors you get two for one! And it includes beer! We had a great day except for the bit at the end, and I might come back once I get over it.",

Because of the light rain there weren't many people in the park, which translated to very short lines. We were able to ride all of our favorite rides without waiting more than 20 minutes. I recommend Cheetah Hunt and Montu. Cheetah Hunt is a fast paced roller coaster, with few drops or flips. Fun for the whole family! It does shoot you out pretty fast though, about 60 mph. Montu is a floor less roller coaster. It has a lot of corkscrews and flips and is very fun!! If you want to cool off on a hot Florida day head to River Rapids, beware you may get soaked! The food in the park was great, head over to Zambia smokehouse for some good BBQ or Pantopia for some good pretzels and brews! The bacon pretzel is a must try. Busch Gardens also has a great tiger exhibit, where you can see them very up close. They also have many other animals like giraffes, zebras, ans even a hiplo!

Not only did it have some of the best coasters we've ever been on (Skeikra and Montu), it is also a dynamite zoo.

The ball!\n\nYou can pay 25 cents to feed the long billed birds, who eat out of your hand, or you can pay $5 or so for a tray full of food, and have the gull swarm you when you leave the checkout stand. That made the kids uproar with laughter.\n\nThe people were all nice but not sickly sweet. They were sort of self-deprecatory in a funny way. On one ride, the Rhino Rally, the driver said \"Lower your heads, and lower your expectations.\" Then \"If anyone drops anything, raise their right hand. Then, I'll raise my right hand. Then we'll both wave goodbye to it, because we don't stop to pick up anything. See all those big animals to your left, those are called people. Then we'll come up on some elephants.\"\n\nWith killer roller coasters, wonderful shows, great kiddie rides, lots of exotic animals that seemed well cared for,  beer served everywhere (and a full bar at one of the places on the right when you first go in), there's something for everyone here.",

In fact, years ago Busch Gardens completely outshined Disney in customer relations. But apparently, no more. The park is beautiful, the animals are fantastic and the rides are great (the ones that are working...) But almost to a person, the mood and attitude of the staff was terrible. They acted as if people were bothering them when asked for information or even at cashier' s counters. This was with every person I observed, not just us. Eye rolling, no eye contact, short curt words, even raised voices!! What a terrible experience for customers who chose this place as their annual vacation destination. The park was not crowded at all, especially for a Saturday... maybe that is why!!",

      "text": "(I'm writing this as a Universal Studios' biggest fan)\n\nThe coasters at Busch Gardens are top-notch! All the other rides are so-so... You'll see the typical splash rides, bumper cars, 4-D shows, rope climbs... the best part is that the park is actually good for the entire family. There are two great sections for kids (with rides and other ways to spend their energy), thrill seekers, and casual observers-- don't forget, half of Busch Gardens is a zoo with some excellent animal exhibits. In addition to the entire east area, smaller animal exhibits are scattered throughout the western side.\n\n the entire park loosely fits under an \"African\" theme... but don't expect well-done themes that surround entire rides (like Disney). This place also has some well-done shows.\n\nPRICE: Ticket value is best of any Florida park. A pass good for the year is the SAME PRICE as a full-paid one-day ticket. No blockout dates. \n\nNormally, the lines are also 30 minutes or less everywhere (BG doesn't get as much love).",

There was a few concession stands where they were training new hires (on the 4th!?) Other concession stands had 4 or 5 people standing around when there was maybe 1 person in front of us and we waited 5 minutes to pay for gouge priced drinks. One person was actually making believe she was drying the counter when in fact she was just moving a wet rag around  in slow motion! The park dfid not have clear signs and we spent the majority of the day running around in circles always stopping and ask directions. The wooden roller coaster was the worst ride ever! The sky ride was not working Falcon Fury should have been open and even finding the parking area was confusing. Between me and my wife paying $600 between gas, hotel, admission, guik queue, parking, and concessions to spend one day here was not worth it! We were so disgusted and disappointed we left before the fireworks show!!",

      "text": "My husband and I visited yesterday on Monday 3/20/17, during Spring Break. We elected to do the \"Quick Queue\" which was quite expensive, but saved us a couple hours. The 30 min behind the scenes elephant tour for $29 was amazing! However, to be there on time, you have to be at the park AT OPENING. It's a tense 15 min trying to get to the front gate to the meeting spot.\n\nWe saw the 30 min Icesploration which was mostly beautifully costumed figure skaters. The hall was quite empty, surprisingly. \n\nFirst star off - afterwards, we went through the lion exhibit. I was sick to my stomach to see that the poor guy was frothing at his mouth and chewing on his tail while a huge group of people gawked/tapped at the glass. It made me sick to see. I really feel like an employee should have been watching for signs of stress and took that poor guy back. \n\nWith that said, all the other animals I saw looked quite content and like they were being given their best life possible given the circumstances. The elephants had a great relationship with their trainers which was so wonderful to see. The poor lion probably just needed a break and the staff should have been more attentive to that.\n\nSecond star off - the Cheetah ride required that any loose items HAVE to be put in a locker that you pay for ($10-$13), but they had the regular cubbies when you got onto the ride to temporarily set your stuff? It felt like such a scam and such a slimey way to make a few extra bucks from your customers.\n\nWe saw an awesome Du-Wop group perform in one of the \"cafeterias\" which made lunch a lot of fun. At the end of our day - 4:30pm - we did the last Safari tour for $39/pp. It was AMAZING. The staff was so knowledgeable and I always felt safe. \n\nOverall, we had a great time. The rides were awesome and the zoo portion was a blast. I just wish they would've been a little more sensitive to the stressed lion and not tried to nickel and dime so much (as you can tell, I'm happy to pay for extras, but goodness, REALLY, making you pay for a locker to ride a ride when they have places to put your stuff for free at the ride itself? The purse they made me put away was literally a clutch. This is just unfair to those who budgeted for their tickets to cover their rides, as they very well should have).",

      "text": "Okay so I visited this park 3/20/16-3/22/16. I purchased the fun card which was $111.92 including taxes and fees. With the fun card you get unlimited entry into Busch gardens until 12/31/16 along with unlimited access into adventure island park until October something. Exact dates are located on fun card. \n\nPARKING: on 3/22 we decided to park which was 12$ at adventure island and visit that park, started cooking in the sun then left and parked in Busch gardens lot for FREE. Just by showing our parking receipt. The other two days we did uber which cost (10$ round trip)which was much quicker and didn't have to worry about the shuttle to the lot. We lodged at a hotel which was literally in walking distance to the park. But didn't want to walk since we will be walking around the park all day. \nIf you request uber tell them to come to front entrance of park via employee parking lot. My uber got lost a couple of times. \n\nENTRANCE: Once at park entrance there is a line to the far right if you have no bags for them to check. Moves pretty fast.\n\nINSIDE PARK: if your electronic devices are on their death beds lucky for you there is a charge station located between the dragon fire grille and scorpion roller coaster ride. FREE OF CHARGE.\n\nIf you invest in the all day dinning plan, you eat once every hour and if you buy snacks in the park u get the second snack FREE. \n\nOverall it was pretty hot and cold those days but me and the kids had a blast anyway. Parks weren't too crowded and we manage to get on some rides two to three times with less than 20min wait.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens is a nice change from Universal Studios, which is where I go every single time I visit Florida. \n\nDefinitely in my top 3 theme parks in terms of rides and attractions. All of their rollercoasters were unique, so I didn't feel like I was wasting my time by going on all of them. When I got bored of rollercoasters, I visited the zoo components of the park. I'd say this is the best zoo I've been to, just an outstanding variety of animals. The train tour around the park is definitely worth it, if you have 45 minutes to spare. Staff was friendly, and food was decently prices at $3 for an order of French fries, and $5.50 (or so) for a funnel cake. \n\nHowever, BEWARE: The only concern I do have is the following. I purchased my ticket for Busch Gardens & Adventure Island before actually visiting, It was a two parks for one deal. I just printed them out. I purchased these tickets from the Busch Gardens website. I assumed that by \"Adventure Island\" they meant the park in Universal Studios, but when I got to Universal Studios (before I went to Busch Gardens), they told me that Adventure Island is in Busch Gardens, and the Universal Studios Park is called \"Island of Adventure.\" I had purchased Busch Gardens and Adventure Island tickets under the assumption that both parks had collaborated to offer some outstanding deal, and the deal was just too good to be true (and it was). So I called Busch Gardens before actually purchasing, and asked them if this deal was in fact for Busch Gardens + Islands of Adventure in Universal Studios (at the time I didn't know that Busch Gardens also had an \"Adventure Island\" park. The Busch Gardens representative told me that the deal is exactly as it sounds, so I went with it. As I stated before, however, I later realized that Adventure Island (The Busch Gardens park) and Islands of Adventure (Universal Park, what I thought my ticket was for) were two very different parks. I can't help but feel that I've been ripped off. First of all, there's the fact that the Busch Gardens representative didn't properly answer my question, \"The deal is exactly as it sounds.\" Second of all, I find that it's a bit coincidental that Universal Studios already had \"Island of Adventure,\" and Busch Gardens conveniently named their other park \"Adventure Island.\" Feels like sort of a scam, to get people to believe that the deal is too good to be true. So I wasn't sure if it was just me or not, but like I said, beware.",

I find it odd that in the day and age of smart phones, they won't let you scan a ticket from your smartphone.

I grew up only a few miles away from Busch Gardens and have always enjoyed the park for its thrill rides and zoo animals.  \nWith the recent updates to the children's area, this park has a spot close to my favorite park amongst my family.  \nThe Sesame Street play area offers plenty of activities for children.  From a splash park (Burt and Ernie's Watering Hole) to the Tree Top Climbing nets, there's enough activities to keep the kids content with adventures of their own.  \nMeanwhile, rides like Sheikra and Cheetah Hunt will have age appropriate guests screaming with excitement as they experience some of the best coasters available in the United States. \nTheir zoo exhibits are some of the best I've experienced.  The Myombe Reserve features all the fascinating primates in a walk thru experience and the Serengeti  hosts the African Lions, Giraffes, Antelope, Elephants, Hyenas and more.  There are even additional tours available to guests who want an up close adventure.  \nThe food in most areas is typical theme park fare.  However, the Smoke House near Sheikra has some great BBQ.  I definitely recommend scheduling your lunch stops at that eatery.  \nThe shows are entertaining and engaging.  Our two favorites are the Madagascar show (for kids) and the newly redesigned animal show near Timbuktu.  \nWith new attractions and themed events added every so often, this park guarantees to impress and provide entertainment for patrons of every age.\nIf it weren't for the shortage of nursing stations for new mothers, this park would be at the top of my list with five stars.  \nProviding comfortable, convenient locations for mothers to tend to their small ones would be the icing on the cake.  Unfortunately, many of the park benches provided in shaded areas are marked for \"smoking sections\".",

There are only two in the US, the other one is in VA. \n\nHad an awesome time there from watching the animals, shows to riding the roller coasters. I was told they had the larggest wooden roller coaster in the country. Note most roller coasters are made of steel but this one was built with all wood. I had so much fun riding, very unique experience. You get discount if you are a Florida resident. Wish I visited it more often when I lived there.",

The rides were fun and the lines weren't long. I would wait until you got to the park to purchase the lie version of the Fast Pass. I bought ours online and only used it for one ride. Also you need to download their app to get exclusive discounts that you won't find online. It also has a map of the park the latest hours of the shows and much more. Now I didn't rate a 5 because of some small issues of the parks areas but it was fun. Two days at most is all you need to see the park. \n\nAs for the food well it's a park so don't expect much but do expect to pay double for everything. It's a park",

      "text": "Hello my family and I visited your park on Friday. Generally we had a good time. Unfortunately though my wife (former Busch Gardens employee) and I got stuck on Sheikra. Things happen, we get that, but we both felt that the situation was mishandled. For starters the communication was poor. We didn't know what was happening until thirty minutes into the ordeal. Even then most of the communicating was done via a manager screaming as far as I could tell. We were in the last \"car\" so I'm not sure if she was coming through on a speaker or not. Once it was determined that we would have to be manually disembarked employees began coming around us to get their safety equipment and the rescue platforms, which was a relief, but they only communicated with each other. There was no check to see if we were ok, had an emergency or if anyone was having a traumatic response. Ideally you would want some reassurance and want someone to take care of those that may be at higher risk for issues. But we got none of that. We weren't properly communicated with until the ordeal had almost ended. Then we were told to see the manager and that she would give us something for enduring this inconvenience. As we walk toward her, she does apologize, however we had to ask her about this \"something\" before she gave it to us, which is problematic from a customer service standpoint. She should've proactively given us those passes. Other customers stopped at guest services because they realized they hadn't been given anything. Also a fast pass for a subsequent visit means nothing for someone coming from out of town or just there as a one off. I could think of tons of better ways to make your customers feel better about Busch Gardens. Like I said, we enjoyed the park for the most part, but this is something that I won't forget.",

      "text": "So this is my first time back here in 30+ years and wow have things changed. So much to do and enjoy. Rides, arcades, safaris, lots of food options and shops. Surprised at the prices being lower than most amusement type parks. Food fairly reasonable and not charged $4 for bottled water. Lockers everywhere to access as needed and certainly before going on some rides where you cannot have anything that you carry. Lockers only 50 cents which is really cheap for some sense of security. \n\nParking was $17 which I thought was kind of steep.\n\nI found this park to have many more attendants around always asking if you need  help or directions. Guides placed strategically throughout the park with microphones giving directions. Makes it easy when you are looking for directions. Live music and dancing engaging the audience so people feel part of the shows. \n\nThe one big drawback is the signage. If there is any suggestion for improvement would be better signs and directions. We walked past the same kiosks 3 times trying to find the exit. No exit signs in the park till you get closer to it. Well darn it I needed to know a lot sooner than that as it was starting to rain heavy and frustration was setting in. Small thing with all the good things but definitely an easy improvement to make life easier for the customer.\n\nDefinitely will be back as we just couldn't see and do everything we wanted.\n\nBuy weekday tickets online as much cheaper and just print them off so no lines to stand in. Need 24-48 hours so tickets can be sent via email. I decided to call for the deal and got them sent within 1 hour so best way to get them if you leave it to the last minute.",

There is a little bit of everything to do here and it really was a lot of fun. We got to see a lot of animals that are in various locations while your walking which is neat. There is also carnival games and a couple of water rides which were refreshing as heck since the Devil was outside smoking a cigarette. My kiddos are different ages so my little one played mostly on the kiddie rides and he was quite content with that. We also saw a show that was an ice show and it was 30 mins long and super cute and fun, I was in there dancing my bootie off lol loads of fun and the prices are very reasonable. I think it's 69.99 and for military families they get a free ticket and 3 extra for there family members which worked great for me I didn't pay a dime yippee (thank you Air Force) if you go with someone that has an annual pass you get a discount of 50 percent off now that's a dang deal people!!!

Somedays, I just go to grab a beer and watch giraffes if I'm not feeling in a mega coaster mood. And when I am experiencing coastermania, they have so many types of coasters for me to get my fix. \n\nIn addition to coasters, they also have some cool shows. I ran into Iceploration to hide from the rain once, and it was quite good. The skaters were very talented. The concerts are also really good and included with your admission. They plan so many different events that I feel like there's always something new to do. \n\nIn terms of food, it's generally pretty affordable. I think the best bets are the Smokehouse, pretzel place, Crown Colony, or the other restaurant in Pantopia. The one in Pantopia is a great place to take a breather, as they have lots of seating and entertainment, too. \n\nOverall, it's a great park, and I will miss having it super nearby. BG treats annual pass holders well and provide lots of nice discounts/promotions. I look forward to seeing what they come up with next.",

Rhino Rally was a big dissapointment, even before I rode the same type of ride at Disney Animal kingdom (Disney does do it better). I enjoyed the shows most of all at the park. The power stilt carnival workers were very colorful. The Tiger enclosure was quite spectacular and were were able to insert our heads into a glass enclosure next to which a white tiger was sleeping (very cool!) The Africa walk was ok, but seemed to lack something I can't quite put my finger on.

As a kid growing up in Ohio, we would make trips to the Cincinnati Zoo and King's Island each summer. Busch Gardens is like the best of both of those parks in one. \n\nMy favorite animal exhibits are Lorikeet Landing, the walk-thru aviary with the tiny dikdik deer, and feeding and petting kangaroos and wallabies in Walkabout Way. \n\nKumba, Montu, and Cheetah Hunt are probably my favorite roller coasters ever. Cheetah Hunt is unlike any coaster I've ever been on because it \"launches\" you. There is no hill to go up, you just shoot forward. It's VERY unique. All 3 that I mentioned are appropriately terrifying. I always ride in the front row too, because seeing what's coming makes the entire experience even MORE terrifying. Scorpion is a fun smaller coaster and Gwazi is enjoyable but a bit more jarring since it's wooden. I haven't ridden Sheikra yet because we couldn't find the entrance (park is really DARK at night!) and rides like Falcon's Fury tend to dislocate my hips...but I hear it's super scary. \n\nThe only complaints I have are I wish that there were a few more unique food offerings (Chicken tenders and fries in Marrakesh? Really?) although the BBQ is pretty good. I also wish that they had a few of the \"intermediate\" rides. The rides are limited to 100% mild or extremely wild. I believe the Sandstorm and the other 1-2 \"scrambler-esque\" rides are gone. \n\nChristmas lights are neat to go see but be aware if you go during ChristmasTown, most of the animals are asleep or their exhibits are closed. \n\nThis is the only park my grandma will still attend with the rest of the family because she knows she can chill at the Colony restaurant, ride the train and skyride, and it's very wheelchair accessible. Even non-thrill-seekers will enjoy a visit to Busch Gardens.",

      "text": "Our family took a vacation to Tampa for Labor Day weekend. The main reason for going was to take our 16 month old to Busch Gardens. This was our second time taking our daughter to a theme park since she has been able to walk. The park itself has a lot to offer. I think my husband and I would have enjoyed it more if either it would have been just the two of us or if our daughter was a little older. She wanted to walk everywhere. It was difficult trying to make sure she didn't run into people. We started her off in the kid section but most of the activities were a little older for her. We were going to let her play in the water but forgot to bring her ear plugs. She wasn't interested in the animals or characters.\n My husband and I were grateful for the parent swap. We were able to ride two roller coasters a piece. We both rode the SheiKra and the Kumba. The SheiKra will take your breath away. My husband rode it first. All I asked when he got off was how it was. I didn't ask what it did. I was able to get right on the ride with the parent swap. I didn't realize it had the 90-degree drop until the ride started. I must say that was the scariest ride I had been on in a long time. The Kumba was okay. It couldn't out do the SheiKra. \nFor lunch, we ate at the Orang Caf\u00e9. We both had the turkey wrap. It had a lot of meat in the wrap, along with tomato and ranch dressing. My husband got fries and I had carrots. There were three different fruits to choose from and three of us shared grapes. \nWe decided we needed to sit in the A/C to cool off. We found the Pirates 4-D theater. Believe the sign outside when it says there are things that will startle young children. My daughter was sitting in my lap when we got sprayed with the water. She was just at the right height to get the water in the face. It scared her to death. \nI think Busch Gardens is a great amusement park. It is a lot to do whether you enjoy roller coaster rides or seeing animals. I think we might wait until our daughter is a little older to take her back so she can really enjoy everything.",

During our visit we experienced longer then usual wait times not because of the amount of people but because of the excruciating slow speed in which they load the ride vehicles! They could lower the wait time by 30+ minutes if they were more diligent when loading. Florida calls for rainy afternoons but never have I seen all the attractions at a park close due to it! Even with just a drizzle and a small dark cloud or 2 they would close every single attraction in the park leaving you with no option but to leave the park and either A. Come back later or B. Return another day! This happened every single day during our visit at least 3-4 times a day. The wait times? Extremely inaccurate! Expect to wait double the time shown on the board or longer due to ride closures! The customer service in the park is lacking significantly. The crew that work the attractions look miserable. Too much empty space! It takes a hike to get from one attraction to the next. Can't they add any shortcuts or at least more attractions? Those carnival rides and games need to go! Seriously for the price of admission I'd expect something a little more epic then some bumper cars. It makes the park look cheap. What's with the old defunct wooden gwazi coaster? It's still standing and a bit of a let down to see it standing there rotting away. Gives off a bad image. There isn't much to do at night here. Leaving me with no other choice but to sit in my hotel room watching re runs of old tv sitcoms. Wouldn't hurt to add some more nighttime entertainment and events. Now! The theming of this park is beautiful! The landscaping is amazing and the sheer size of the park is jaw dropping! The new Cobras Curse coaster should set the new standard for all attractions that should be built in this park in the near future! Wonderful queue! Wonderful ride! Up to par with the Orlando parks! LOVED LOVED LOVED IT! Also there are some great deals here if you look for them so it can lead to a pretty affordable trip if you take the time to look. I give Busch Gardens a 3 knowing this park can and hopefully will be a 5 after they add in some more well themed attractions. Not just some run of the mill roller coasters. We will be back and I hope to add some more stars to this review and update.",

Lots of fun to be had on all the rides and shows.  The Pirate 4D show is very old but still enjoyable. (No respect, No repect at all line worked well for Rodney Dangerfield in the 80's and Early 90's but he's been gone for a long while.

The food is really bad, though. Even worse than Universal for food. Which is saying something. The Sesame Street area is good for kids over about 3. They don't allow really young kids to go on anything, even in the kids area! For kids under 3ish, pay the extra and go to Disney so the youngsters can ride.",

The food is pretty expensive but tastey, and not to mention a good portion. We ate at the Zambia Smokehouse and i had the brisket sandwich. The ribs and chicken are also very good. Aside from the rollercoasters you can go on a safari, observe the animals, pet kangaroos (one actually licked my hand :) , watch their cute little 4-D pirate show, etc. This is definitely a must if you are in the Tampa area.",

It's like Disney's Hollywood Studios plus Animal Kingdom. I've gone to the Williamsburge Virgina Busch Gardens, its definitely a lot smaller than this one.\n\nThis is an all day park if you've never gone before, meaning you need to spend all day here to actually see and do everything.  There are the attractions (rides), shows, plus the animal habitats and educational encounters.\n\nLOVE:\n\nRoller Coasters:\n-Kumba\n-Montu \n-Scorpion\n-Cheetah Hunt-It was fun, not amazing, but fun for one ride, but since its one of the newest ride its the busiest and breaks down the most as it did when the hubs and I rode it. It broke down for 20 minutes with us still on it and in a horizontal position close to the exit (thankfully).\nIt took a while to exit but they gave us an express pass for one ride and water...so that was nice at least!\n-Falcon's Fury-Also a new ride, also breaks down. However it was fine for us, super scary and fun looking down from the top but doesn't last as long as I hoped.\n-The Animal Care Center-A great place to cool down and check out live animal checkups, treatments, and maybe even a surgery.\n-ALL THE ANIMAL HABITATS-Seriously, we just didn't have time to see them all.\n\nIf you're local an annual pass is definitely worth the price since you can get Sea World and Aquatica as well!",

A one day ticket here is $80 pp.  apparently there is no such thing as a child ticket lol.  It's $80 3 and up.  Value days for families with a few members on Wednesdays it is 65 if that will help.  See I promise an annual pass is a better value $99 at Costco.  You can go to Aqaitica and Seaworld or miss and match parks or get a pass for all three parks.  Of course we have all three.  The best thing about that is we go all the time.  The meal pass is $49 for three kids but $32 pp for adults.  It's all you care to eat and works at select restaurants throughout the parks.  The fun is unlimited but don't let the prices kick you running.  Any family can afford to come to Bush Gardens.  You can also take advantage of their ez pay and pay less than $20 a month pp. for an annual pass.  Now if that doesn't grab you just save up and come any way.  You will love it.!",

If you skip the Orlando park scene, then give Busch Gardens a day. On the other hand, if you do visit the Orlando theme park machine, Busch Gardens deserves your opinion. Either way, you won't regret it. \n\nBorn and raised in Tampa. I've watched this park grow and evolve. From literally a garden on the grounds of a now defunct brewery, to a world-class roller coaster theme park, Busch Gardens has always entertained every age, class, creed and taste. \n\nThere is way more to do at the park then you can fit into a day, which is one reason why locals like me keep coming back. The roller coasters are a blast, but if the place is busy go see the animals or a show. Bring the young kids to the sesame street themed kids park or treat the family to a meal at the crown colony house with it's safari based decor. Albeit expensive, but even the shops have unique gifts for the folks back home. \n\nWhether you're in town for the weekend or live a couple miles away, the park does a fantastic job of mixing it up and keeping the entertainment fresh for families of any size. Don't hesitate to give them a try if you're thinking about having a great day of fun!",

      "text": "Go early for the new rides. We made the mistake and went towards Gwanzi when we arrived at 11am (past Sat). Gwanzi was closed so we made our way to Sherika and got right on with no wait. We then went to Kumba and there was not a single person in line. We thought to ourselves this is great. We can ride all day and not have to wait in line. We we found out whey there were no lines on the side of the park we went to. Everyone was in line for the Falcon and Cheeta. both of those lines had a 70 min wait so we did not get a chance to ride them.\n\n My advise is also to avoid getting on the train and the sky mover at a different location other than where these new rides are. We decided to get on the sky ride (don't know the name of it) that is right next to Cheeta and we had to wait for 30 min. We could see empty pods coming in but all of them were full when they left our station (by all means ride it from the other side of the park and you will not have to wait). \n\nWe did get the all you can eat meal ticket. Wow, I could hardley move by the end of the day. All of the food we had was good except for the pasta buffet. I won't eat there again. I should have known something was up when there were only a few people in the entire place. The only think I liked there were the meatballs. \n\n\nSo pros: nice and cool, park was not crowded other than by the new rides, the meal pass was great (get the brisket and the bread pudding from the smokehouse, yum), good entertainment. \n\nCons: The following were closed, Guanzi, the gorillas exhibit, the Madascar show, and a few other animal exhibits. \n\nWe will go again but not anytime soon. We want the new car smell to wear off of the new rides and then we will go again.",

I would suggest that you DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME IN THE SUMMER!!! Holy Jesus, I mean there are so many tourist (long lines, welcome to summer in Florida) and with the heat it's really not worth it. \n\nWhen it comes to cost...I sold my left kidney to enjoy the day. 100+ ticket, 22 to park, 20 for lunch, etc etc etc...I feel bad for you people that have kids, you'd probably have to take a second mortgage! \n\nAt the end of the day though, (if everything is functional), the park is a lot of fun. Lots of variety for everyone, rides, animals, shows, games, play areas...it's got it all, just be prepared to drop dollars. Enjoy!",

      "text": "OMG YELP! Thank you again for a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to visit Busch Gardens for their Christmas Town event that is held annually in December. Thanks to Yelp, we were given free admission to the park, free parking, a complimentary snack and drink and front of the line passes for all rides. \n\nThere are several things you can do at Busch Gardens and its appropriate for people of all ages. They have several shows located throughout the park. There are rides specifically for small children and a Sesame Street/Elmo themed section of the park for children as well. If you love animals, Busch Gardens is great. There is a safari type ride and several exhibits with different animals located all over the park. \n\nThe roller coasters are my favorite part of the park. They are FANTASTIC! My ultimate fave is the Cheetah Hunt. Man oh Man! Talk about roller coaster heaven. The ride was just perfect. Longer than most roller coasters and the track looks like a long cube, so Im not quite sure how the seats stay on the track but they do and it adds to the trill. Complete with speed, several turns, drops, and loops this coaster is the ultimate thrill seeker's dream ride. We also got on Sheikra, which is a close second to Cheetah Hunt complete with two 90 degree drops, be prepared to scream. Scorpion is an oldie but goodie with its super speed and quick turns it will definitely give you an unexpected thrill. Last but certainly not least, the new falcon's fury ride. Sitting in a seat and being slowly raised up, up, up...and up. I remember thinking, ummmm...okay, how far up are we actually going to go?! Then your seat lifts leaving you face down looking at the ground and finally, without noticed, you are DROPPED AT FULL SPEED! I'll just let that thought sink in for a minute lol. It's so fun! \n\nThe Christmas Town was extremely nice. There were several areas where you can take Christmas and winter themed pictures, lots of season inspired foods, a cute train ride and several shows to watch. Very family friendly and a great addition for the Christmas Season! \n\nSo thank you Yelp for this fun and HIGHLY recommend if you're in the Tampa area to try this theme park",

The roller coasters are really fun and we went on a weekday so the lines weren't very long.\n\nThis theme park sticks out from the others because it's kind of like a zoo as well. I was able to let birds walk all over me. I was able to pet kangaroos. I watched a trainer feed an elephant, and there were many more animals I saw! The coolest thing we saw though was the white tiger! We were able to go into one of those bubbles and see the tiger up close (refer to my video, it's AWESOME).\n\nI really just wish the food was better and cheaper but hey, what do you expect from a theme park?",

My most recent adventure at the park came during Christmas when a group of co-workers and I visited Christmas Town.  Overall it was an enjoyable holiday outing and the lighting done by the park in the Christmas Town area was amazing.  \n\nAs far as the park itself goes, who doesn't like going to a theme park and letting all of their worries go by the wayside.  There is plenty do here for anyone of any age.  There are kids areas with kid rides all the way down to various safari adventures and insane roller coasters.  The only coaster I have yet to try is Falcon's Fury as that one seems a bit much even for me.  Otherwise I've been on all of the coasters and had a blast.  Gwazi is the only one I would ever complain about given that you may need to see a chiropractor after taking a ride on it, but that one should be closed by February.",

Then at the pretzel place, the bacon pretzel was so salted it was unbearable. And I promise you the cinnamon sugar pretzel from the mall is such much more yummy than at this place. I feel that the employees pay little to no attention when preparing the food. I wish I could get a refund on the food. I'm not picky but a level of quality is expected from an expensive theme park, especially if since the prices for the food are high.",

The whole atmosphere of the park is pretty amazing, from the great thrill rides, to the vast selection of animals to observe and take pictures, to the tasty food. I would say if you are a local resident, then the annual pass is definitely the smartest option. For less than two full-day prices, you receive unlimited entrances to the park, as well as free parking (saves you $20 alone right there). The annual perks for the pass members are also well worth it, as well as the perk of the month. If you haven't been yet, definitely check it out, and if you are planning a trip to Tampa Bay or Orlando, be sure to add Busch Gardens Tampa to your itinerary.",

It's the only wooden roller coaster and it really offers big thrills.  It's the most thrilling aside from Sheikra.  Montu is well renowned for being a great floorless coaster with alot of twists and turns.  Scorpion and Kumba are solid coasters also. Sheikra is the most terrifying thing I've ever been on, especially at night.  Hanging with your face down 200 feet in the air waiting to be dropped is very intimidating.  It happens twice by the way.  The park is very large and one of the more difficult parks to navigate around.  I highly recommend Rhino Rally or the safaris.  They also have a whitewater rafting ride and a flume ride.  The railroad can take you from one side of the park to the other and offer great views.  Busch Gardens is one of the greatest parks ever especially if you love roller coasters. Not as much as a reality turning special effects festival as Universal or Disney but definitely scarier more intense rides.",

We got to our hotel and we called Bush Gardens and I was amazed that they don't do anything unless you do stop at the park customer service, really very impractical for people and on our case very dangerous, sorry to say but I did not feel like a wanted customer.... would likely not come back....

Friday night, we went to see Rudolph. \nWe were quoted 25 min wait. \nAn hour and 15 minutes later, we finally went inside. \nWhile we were waiting, a kid hit my son in the head with a rock. The parents did nothing. \nI tried to find a manager. No one would help me or find someone. \nIt was so dark inside that none of my pictures came out. All too dark. \nBy the time we finished, it was too late to see Santa since the kids were melting down from the Rudolph wait. \nWe came back today, Sunday, to see Santa. \nWe waited an hour. Not a bad wait, the week before Christmas. \nI asked the elf if she would take a picture of all 4 of us. She said, \"no, I will not,\" opened the curtain and said we could leave. \nHowever, I spoke with another friend that came just last week and she said the elf happily took her entire party's picture WITH HER CAMERA. \nSo, now I have NO pictures of us with Santa after an hour wait. \nI didn't know the elf wouldn't take our picture.  They have taken our picture the past 3 years. \nI went to guest services to talk to someone. Marilyn wouldn't help me. She sent me to Jon. He was rude and told me to buy the $99 CD. \nSo, they are losing 9 pass holders when all they had to do was take our picture. We have been pass holders for the past 3 years.

The line at the front is always long and the attendant there told us to go to the kiosk near Cobras furry or another one. So we went to the kiosk and I waited 30 minutes in the scorching heat, which is fine I understand there would be a wait but once I was second in the line THE MACHINE BROKE and the attendant told us to find another kiosk. He took the people in front to print their tickets so I thought hey we all deserve this privilege after waiting so long!!!! So I followed him back to the very from of the park easily a 10 minute walk and when I confronted him and told him I waited a long time also and want to have my pre bought tickets printed he proceeded to tell me he didn't have time for that and walked away!!!

It's been a while since I've been to an amusement park and I have to say this was a nice way to re-introduce myself :). \n\nIt wasn't too big where we felt overwhelmed and like we couldn't get everything done. But it wasn't too small either. I liked the aspect of it being part amusement park and part zoo. We got to see some beautiful animals. I hadn't seen an orangutan before and they had one here. I saw the most exquisite white tiger..o my; the eyes on this creature were stunning. I'm sad I didn't get a picture, but it's ok. I'll just have to come back. A\n\nI liked the fact that they had a designated area for children. It was called the Sesame Street Safari of Fun. It had age appropriate rides for the kiddos and a really nice play place area suited with a huge bouncy area and obstacle course. I kinda wanted to go on myself lol. \n\nI rode a couple of the coasters. The one that gripped my heart every time I heard it was the Falcon's fury. If you're a thrill seeker, you will NOT be disappointed. I did not have the courage to try it. Every time I heard that noise to signal the drop, my heart just sank. I did enjoy the water rides and the cheetah hunt (which was enough thrill for me lol) and they were all fun. \n\nBeware of overpriced food (but that goes without saying at any attraction like such) \n\nWe'll be back though.

However, their overly restrictive lightning policy makes for a longer park experience than expected, due to waiting around. They claim it's if lightning is spotted within a 10 mi radius, but I've seen rides get shut down just for clouds. I look up and see nothing but clouds and mixed sunshine. I check the weather sites and it shows clouds and sunshine, no rain or storms. I ask how long and they say when the storm passes (what storm again?). Maybe they need to update their weather equipment and personnel? I don't know... I'm guessing someone got struck once, somewhere, and it cost someone a lot of money :). Still, even if a quick que ticket can bypass long lines for a little extra money ($50 per ticket), the clouds in the sky will slow you down for sure.

Make sure you spend the $10.95 for a refillable soft drink cup. Negatives-long, long, long lines for rides-plan on waiting an hour for a ride. After we waited forever to ride on Shireka, we went to purchase Que Passes (fast lane passes) but they were sold out. Food was typical amusement park fare and very expensive.

Wasserbahnen, bei denen man dank des ganzj\u00e4hrig warmen Wetters ruhig auch mal nass werden kann, einen Teil mit Kinder-Karussells, einem Kirmes-Bereich, in dem es die typischen Kirmes- Fahrgesch\u00e4fte gibt und vieles andere.\n\n\n Bei Kostenfaktor ist noch zu erw\u00e4hnen, dass das Parken am Park mit 14$ und z.b. das ausleihen eines Buggys f\u00fcr Kinder mit 15$ ebenfalls noch mal ordentlich zu Buche schlagen.\nPositiv ist allerdings, dass das Essen f\u00fcr Freizeitparkverh\u00e4ltnisse noch relativ g\u00fcnstig ist. Au\u00dferdem k\u00f6nnen die Tages Eintrittskarten an einem 2. Tag innerhalb von 7 Tagen zum Wieder-Eintritt in den Park genutzt werden.\nF\u00fcr ADAC Mitglieder gibt es \u00fcbrigens auch immerhin einen Rabatt von 5$ auf den Eintrittspreis.\n\n\n Insgesamt war der Park sehr ordentlich, sowohl auf den Wegen als auch in Restaurants und Toiletten waren fast st\u00e4ndig Angestellte mit Reinigungen besch\u00e4ftigt. Au\u00dferdem gab es an vielen Stellen im Park Spender zur Handdesinfektion!\n\n\n Da wir im M\u00e4rz, nach den Fr\u00fchlingsferien in Florida und in der Woche dort waren, war es insgesamt angenehm leer, so dass es nirgendwo \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig lange Wartezeiten gab.\n\n\n Fazit: insgesamt sehr empfehlenswert, auch wenn der Preis erst mal ein wenig schockiert :-)",

General parking costs $20 while preferred parking (spots closer to the entrance of Busch Gardens Tampa Bay) costs $26. After we parked our car at the general parking area, we took a short walk to the tram station which takes guests to Busch Gardens. Probably a 2 minutes ride. The frequency of the trams were pretty good (less than 5 minutes) and soon, we were entering into Busch Gardens. Take note that the parking areas are on the opposite side of the road of Busch Gardens. The tram enters Busch Gardens via an underground pass. So don't be surprised if the signs direct you away from Busch Gardens.",

Too bad the customer is not number one.  There should be exceptions to the rule or special allowances.  I could see if the other person was in possession of the card but I bought it.

I am not sure what it is like normally but since it was around the holidays and a bit chilly, the park was pretty empty!\n\nThey do have a good number of roller coasters and my favorite was Shreikra.  I also enjoyed Kumba and the other newer loop-de-loop roller coaster.  It was too cold for the water rides but we did see some brave souls on them.  However, they absolutely need to get rid of the wooden roller coaster!  I literally was afraid we were going to fly off the track and it was so bouncy, I thought my head was going to snap right off the top of my spine.  I used to love American Eagle at Six Flags in IL and that was made of wood so I am not sure what is going on with this one.\n\nThey also had animals and a ski-lift type ride, as well as a \"safari\" ride.  I saw some bands play and they even had an ice skating show that was Christmas themed, which was pretty good!\n\nThe park was very clean and well kept.  I think this is definitely a good place to spend the day!",

      "text": "I hadn't been to Busch Gardens in over a decade, but a friend wanted to hit the coaster circuit for his 39th birthday. So our gang of seven guys, ranging from late 30s to early 50s, trekked over to Tampa for the day.\n\nI tend to think of Busch Gardens as more of an \"amusement\" park and less of a \"theme\" park. While it has themed areas in terms of the design of the buildings, it's not as full-on thematically as areas at Disney or Universal can be. But that's not why you visit here: you visit here for the rides.\n\nWe were in the park about eight hours, with a couple of leisurely cocktail stops along the way. In that time, we got on seven rides, on a day with extremely short waits. (Our second-longest wait was to get off of SheiKra, which apparently was on the verge of breaking down just as we were second-in-line to return to the loading platform.) I can't imagine getting much more done in a full-length, fully packed summer day.\n\nWe had a good time, but we also noticed a little \"run-down\" look in many areas of the park -- most notably Gwazi, which has had one half shuttered (this being the \"new thing\" last time I went), with its whole structure looking really aged. And regrettably, age has caught up with my equilibrium, too, so I ended up a spectator as others went on what used to be my favorite coaster in Florida,  Kumba. Sigh.\n\nPart of me would like to go back to do the half of the park we essentially skipped in our quest to hit all the coasters -- take a slower pace, take in the shows, all that. But I figure we'll wait for the next new big thing to open to justify the drive, the time and the cost.",

      "text": "I will preface this review by saying I may be slightly biased, I receive two free annual passes every year because my father works at the park.\n\nBusch Gardens is one of my favorite parks. There is a great assortment of rides, animal attractions, and shows.\n\nAs far as rides go, BG is a must for roller coaster fans. I'd rate it as probable having the best roller coasters in the southeast, and BG gives the rest of the parks in the country a run for their money. The best part about the coasters is they have varying degrees. You can start out on one of the older slower coasters, giving new riders a taste of the fun, and work your way up to faster, more intense experiences. The rest of the rides in the park are all fun, wait times are fairly short, and most importantly, the rides all appear clean and upkept.\n\nI love BG for the animal attractions. The Edge of Africa area has some really unique animal exhibits, and you can really get up close to some of the animals. The new animal nursery/surgery area is really neat also, and again, its fun to get right up near the animals. The variety of animals at the park have decreased over the years, but for the past several years, BG has maintained the animal exhibits at a fairly steady level.\n\nThe only reason that I am not giving BG five stars, is for the restaurant selection. Like any theme park, there is your selection of quick walk through lines if you want to just grab lunch and go. Sadly, there is only one really sit down option, the Crown Colony House. Now don't get me wrong, the Crown Colony House is great, and the family style meal option is perfect for big families. I would like maybe one or two more options though, just for some variety.\n\nOverall BG is an excellent park and I make sure to visit several times a year.",

But there is NO shortage of friendly helpful staff and things to do. \nIt has been YEARS since I had been here, and so much has changed. I enjoyed the animals and the feeding/petting more than the rides.

We all loved it so much we didn't want to leave.\nThere is the cutest kids section, so there is fun for everyone!\n\nFood is typical amusement park food and prices. I had to wait an extra long time for a burger, as they ran out at the time....but then it was hot and fresh! Just the way I like it!\n\nParking is 20.00 a car or 22.00 preferred parking which parks up by the gate. Trams are there for getting you back and forth to you car when needed.\n\nThey have photographers all through out the park taking pictures of your day...so be prepared to smile a lot! :)\n\nTake sunscreen and later up as the hot sun will get you....but if you forget...they sale it there in the gift shops. OH...and if your phone battery is dying...they have charging stick stations to purchase, which I understand that you can exchange also at Disney....what's not to like about that!",

I haven't been here in over 30 years the last time I went to Busch gardens it's was associated with  Anheuser Busch. What a nice surprise. We went on a Thursday afternoon. The only draw back is that all the rides were closed at about 4:00 due to inclement weather. A lighting and thunderstorm hit the area. The ride lines move fast and all the staff that we stopped and asked questions to were quite friendly. \nAnother great thing was that most of the animals were out and about. All were in range to get good pictures.\nWe are at a theater where a rock and doo woop show was being put on. Shout out to the performers they did a great job. I had a blast singling along with them although my daughter kept asking me to stop.\nOne last note, due to the weather we could come back tomorrow show our ticket and visit the park again. Great deal.  This is definitely someplace to visit in Florida, we will come back  again.\n\nPs-the roller coasters are pretty great as well.",

It's a family theme park, but for parents who wish to ride the bigger rides, but have smaller children with them, it can pose a challenge....Busch Gardens has world class coasters! I'm a big fan of Kumba (my favorite), Montu, Cheetah Hunt &  Sheikra. Out of all the coasters, Cheetah Hunt's line was the longest @ 60 min. All others were 30 min or less. Cheetah Hunt is still very popular. We didn't get a chance to ride the new Cobra's Curse. The wait was 75 min when we thought about riding it, so we decided to skip it this time. We bought annual passes so we'll have more chances to check it out.....My one big gripe about Busch Gardens is the park's layout. Its very difficult to navigate. There are quite a few dead-ends in the park that force you out of your way to get to certain attractions. There are signs with arrows throughout the park that will lead you to popular attractions but they aren't consistent enough. Busch Gardens is like a zoo and Theme Park combined, so the layout is more organic. I feel like the signage needs to be better and it needs more shortcuts to make getting from section to section easier. Busch Gardens is a great place overall though. I'm fortunate to live about 30 min away. It goes without saying that if you're a local or visiting from out of town, you have to check out Busch Gardens!",

      "text": "Busch Gardens is not exactly conducive to families with little kids, despite it's many zoo attractions, simply because almost all of the rides are rollercoasters. However if you are a thrill master (or have a bunch of teenage kids) this place is a must visit!\n\nThe Good: \n\nThrills not found anywhere else: This place has some amazing rollercoasters, including the most amazing SheiKra. This rollercoaster simply cannot be described. It has a completely 180 degree drop where you can't even see the track. It is truly exhilarating, and I have been to several thrill parks in my day. Trust me, this one ride is worth the ticket price for thrill seekers.\n\nGreat Zoo attractions: Although this place is primarily known as a thrill destination, their animal attractions are equally amazing, especially the new Jungala attraction, which features monkeys, alligators, and tigers, oh my!\n\nFree Beer: Go to the hospitality center, check out the horses and knock back a cold one. What more could you ask for??\n\nI love going to Busch Gardens, and even though my daughter is not tall enough for most of the thrills, she still enjoys the different zoo attraction, and I love tag teaming with the husband on the rollercoasters.\n\nOverall 8.9/10= Busch is Best!!",

What use to be a blend of beautiful gardens, wildlife and fun rides had turned into worn, overpriced tourist stop. Incredibly disappointing and sad.  Half of the attractions today were closed for 'maintenance' but appear to be deserted. No one in sight working on them.  The 'safari' appeared to be in poor condition with minimal animals in sight.",

      "text": "I Like Busch Gardens.\n\nI am a huge roller-coaster fan. I am a huge amusement park fan. I even like the scary corner carnivals and state fairs. So it would follow that I like an amusement park with 4 large Coasters.\n\nI am also from Miami, so I am used to and know how to dress/what to bring to deal with the heat and humidity. (They also sell hand-held \"squirt fans\" which are awesome.)\n\nGood Stuffs:\nIf you buy their \"Souvenir Cup,\" you can get cheap refills in it, even if you bring it back another day.\nCool animal attractions, where you will actually SEE animals. Both walk-through and Safari-Type rides. (Rhino Rally)  You can also see the animals from the Montu and Kumba coasters, and from the park-wide train.\nDecent food. For a park. Expensive? Yes. But edible.\n\nSpecifics:\nThe Skeik'Ra coaster is amazing. It has a full 90 degree drop. Sit up front. It's amazing and terrifying. It's floorless, so your feet are dangling and you are held to your seat at that first drop only by the shoulder bar, staring STRAIGHT DOWN before the drop. Whooooosh. To the Max.\nThe Montu is an Egyptian-themed inverted coaster. It's smooth and twisting, looping through landscaped grounds and with killer views of the \"Safari\" animals to the north. The first climb and drop are killer. This is a coaster you can ride again and again.\nThe Kumba is one of Bush Gardens' first \"legendary\" coasters. It's a steel track, with loops, barrel rolls, and corkscrews. It, too, is a must.\nThe Gwazi. I am not a fan of wooden coasters.  At all. But this one seems bumpier and rougher than most. I generally skip it.\nCongo River Rapids: You'll get soaked. It's fun.  But try to hit it at the end of your visit, and have towels in the car. (Always have towels in the car for a Florida Theme Park visit anyway. It rains at 3:30 pm every day in the Wet Season. The \"Dry Season\" is \"Winter\" 3 months out of the 9.)\nThe Scorpion: A cute kiddie-style coaster. Not a true Kiddie Coaster but much gentler than the others.\n\nThere are exhibits and shows, too. The Clydsedales are impressively massive. (And smelly) But still a sight to see.\nThe Tiggers (ahem. \"Tigers\") are gorgeous.\nThere's Elephants, Hippos, Lions, Hyenas and more in the \"Edge of Africa.\" And they are usually OUT. VISIBLE. It's great.\nThe Serengeti Plain has free-roaming Zebras, Girraffes, and other African Animals which you may observe from an aerial tram or the Serengeti Express Train.\nAlligators in the Pond. They're HUGE. And they're RIGHT THERE. Very Cool.\nThe Monkeys. (Apes?) (Gorillas?) Whatever. Walk through. It's neat.\n\nThe Tips:\nIt's Florida. Bring Sunscreen. Have towels in the car or in a locker. Perhaps a change of shirt and socks as well, in case of rain or sweat. I usually wear a bathing suit under my shorts and tank top.\nIf you'll be in the area for an extended time, consider their multi-park pass for Sea World in Orlando as well. (And don't miss the Kracken Coaster. OMG!)\nBring Ponytail Bands. Crazy Coasters can turn long hair into a birdsnest very quickly. Also it can help you cool down.\nDrink lots of water. \nBring a disposable camera, or hold on to yours REALLY tight. There are no lockers at the rides, and they're pay-per-use in the park.\nGet there early. Remember: It rains at 3:30pm in Florida. They WILL close rides if lightning is in the area.\nWear COMFORTABLE SHOES. Flip Flops tend to fly off on roller coasters, and they often make you take them off. Keep that in mind.\nOh, and the ICE CREAM PARLOR near the FRONT GATE?  Yeah, It's AIR CONDITIONED! Sit there for a bit if it's sweltering.\n\nLastly, HAVE FUN! It's an AMUSEMENT PARK and there's lots to do, but the experience is what you make it. Enjoy what Busch Gardens has to offer. It's a great place, with something to amuse everyone, from the kidlets to the crazy coaster enthusiast and everyone in between.",

      "text": "Busch gardens, while clean and organized, is not at all what it used to be. \n\nWe went on a Tuesday during February school vacation with the kids. We looked online for discounted tickets and we're not able to find any, so we used our AAA card for $5 off each ticket. Sadly, that didn't make much of a dent in the price - we paid approximately $370 for a day of disappointments. \n\nFirst off, while this sounds petty, it became important throughout our day, the map sucked. It was not designed to actually help navigate the park. I won't go into detail, but just be prepared to spend a lot of time staring at it and not really knowing which way to turn to get where you want to go.\n\nWe were with our two kids, age 4 and 10. We were really looking forward to a ride we could go on together, which was almost impossible to find, unless you want to ride the little kid rides in the Sesame Street area over and over again. \n\nThe Congo River Rapids was closed, which was one of the few rides we would have been able to go on together. Apparently it had been closed for several weeks, and they did not know when it would open again. \n\nMy husband made a good point: we paid a ton of money -- and they can't fix their rides more efficiently? This is their business, it should be top priority to fix the rides that are broken.\n\nThere were quite a few incredible looking roller coasters - though we would have to ride those separately, since the kids couldn't go on them... But that was to be expected.  \n\nSesame Street was good, and it was nice that they had the characters available to take pictures with. \n\nIn all, we spent $370 for the four of us, which was just the tip of the iceberg. They get you for every cent you have when you are in there. They charge for every little thing - beers are $8, a slice of pizza (ONE slice) was $8, and slushy drinks for the kids (NOT in one of their super expensive Busch Gardens plastic tumblers) was $4. Oh, and you can't get a lid for the kids cups. Apparently this is due to the wild life. But it makes no sense, because they have plenty of other items that could be dangerous to the wildlife. How about straws, or beer bottle tops? It just all seemed like a ploy to get you to buy the reusable, and much more expensive, memorabilia cups, which, oh yeah, did I mention they were all out of the kid size at both locations we visited to get one? So it was either an adult size cup - you guessed it - for $8, or a plastic cup without a lid for $4. Caught between wanting to have fun and get a few cups for the kids to bring home and not wanting to feed into their ridiculous money making scam.\nThere were other rides that were closed, but we weren't as sad about those as we were about the Congo river ride. \n\nOne last point: if you do end up going and you have the time, at least buy the tickets so you can return again (they were the exact same price as the one day tickets - which makes sense I guess because they make so much money off of everyone when they are stuck there to eat and drink away all of their money). You will find that one day isn't really quite enough time to get to a lot of the rides. Especially if it's busy, the wait in line will eat up a lot of your day.\n\nAnd also: the train ride was actually quite good. You could see a lot of the animals - pretty close up. The sky ride was fun for all of us, but you weren't able to see many of the animals from there. \n\nThe \"air Grover\" ride in Sesame Street was fun, and it surprised me that it was actually quite fast and a bit scary for smaller kids. Thankfully, our 4 year old is more if a daredevil, when it comes to rides, than our 10 year old.",

The park is laid out in a somewhat mazelike circle so be sure to bring a map or you may end up back at the beginning without having experienced everything it has to offer.\nThe reason I only give 4 stars is because the animals on site always seem a bit depressed.  Their enclosures are small and seem cramped especially the elephants which never seem happy.  On specialty nights like Howl O Scream especially the animals don't seem to understand what is happening and seem upset.\n\nThe rides and food are 5 stars but they should either get rid of the animals by sending them to places where they can have bigger enclosures or build a separate park.\nI highly recommend Busch Gardens for the thrill seeker visiting Tampa Bay.",

Possibly the scariest part is the first hill.  That is one huge drop and right up into a loop.  Check it out on You Tube if you want a glipse...\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZ_hve5K2s\n\nThe other coaster that is worth riding is Cheetah Run.  Smooth!  \n\nWe opted for the all you can eat along with the day pass and i do think it was worth it.   It's been a couple of weeks now but I believe it was about $10 extra for the all you can eat wrist band.  Parking was another cost- again it's been a couple weeks but I think it was about $15.  Book your tickets online and there is a small savings and skip the lines at the gate go to the quick print on the right side of the gates.  \n\nFUN DAY!!",

Feeling my stomach in my throat and being dizzy all day just doesn't do it for me.  If you like crazy rides, this is the park for you.\n\nI went on three rides at the park and here's the scoop....\n\n1.  Congo River Rapids = LOVE on a hot day.  My clothes were soaked, my purse was soaked, and my sneakers were sloshy AND I loved it.\n\n2.  Montu- I finally got the courage to go on a stupid roller coaster.  This ride will make you dizzy. \n\n3.  Family Safari - don't waste your time.  If I waited an hour for this ride, I'd be pissed.  The ride is a small circle, looks at a few animals, and then you finish up.  Do yourself a favor and check out the animals on the walking path.\n\nI ate lunch at a table where I could watch Shekira.  I loved watching the roller coaster while enjoying ribs, coleslaw, and a salad.  I split a meal with my boyfriend and we were both satisfied.  Oh and ask for tap water if you're cheap, they'll give it to you.  \n\nThe animals were great.  If you're an animal lover, you'll enjoy walking through the animal exhibits.

My only complaint is you spend $95 for a ticket to get in and they have a hero safari ride that is really cool, but it's not included in your ticket. You have to pay an additional $39 to take the safari ride, and I think that's absurd. Needless to say, I want spending the additional money after already throwing out over $250 on tickets and lunch.

Bringing a lot of sunscreen and/or an umbrella will really improve your experience at Busch Gardens. \n\nThe rides are very exciting if you are an adrenaline junkie, but if you are easily queasy, then I would go to a more child friendly park like Disney world. \n\nUnfortunately during our visit, there was heavy rainfall for a couple for hours that made us wait for the rain to stop so we could ride the rest of the rides. \n\nTip: I know that a lot of people who come to Busch Gardens travel far to experience the fun but when it rains, you're able to let the employees know to get a raincheck for another day!\n\nWe received a rain check to attend the park again.

      "text": "Family and I came on Sunday 12/10/17. This was my second time here. My previous visit years ago was when Cheetah Hunt did not exist, so needless to say I was really excited to ride this coaster first. We got to the park when it opened at 10am. We ran to Cheetah Hunt, only to find out it was a delayed opening due to an unknown ride malfunction. We waited in the line for it to open for about an hour until we got fed up and decided to walk through the rest of the park and come back to it later. Next we went to Cobra's Curse, same thing. This coaster was also closed due to an unidentified ride issue. Kumba was also shut down that day (looked like they permanently retired it, with no notice to the public). Sheikra and Montu were working, but we wound up watching shows our entire visit and eating. Cheetah Hunt finally opened near the end of the day and we were able to get one ride on it before leaving. I was slightly disappointed we paid full price only to be able to ride a few select rides and not all; so hence my deduction of one star. Some of the food venues were also advertising for kettle corn only to find out that they didn't have any made for sale. We love the animals and Christmas decor around this time of year. I'm sure I'm season, it's a fabulous place when everything's working!",

      "text": "I have never been to a Busch Gardens before, but I LOVE amusement parks and roller coasters. My husband and I were lucky enough to go on an overcast day, so we basically walked right into the park and onto every ride.\n\nThe first ride we went on - SheiKra - was by far the best of the day, and possibly the best roller coaster I've ever been on! The first drop, where you're basically hanging vertically at the top? Whoa Nelly!!!\n\nWe didn't get to go on every ride, as it started raining about an hour and a half before the park closed and one or two were closed for maintenance anyway (note to park employees: do NOT tell guests that a ride is having technically difficulties and that it will probably be open later in the day!). Beware the River Rapids: we thought we'd get a bit soaked but ended up DRENCHED. We looked as if we jumped in. We were so uncomfortable, we ended up buying a change of clothes at the park! (Only to then get rained on...)\n\nOur biggest complaint was the employees. You could tell that most of them did not want to be there/did not care about their job/were just waiting for the day to end. No one was mean, but most of them were just very nonchalant and sort of brushed us off and went back to their cell phones/friends.\n\nOur other complaint was that there's no quick way to get around. When it started pouring, we had to run back to the locker where we'd stored our stuff. Yet to get to the locker and back to the exit, we basically had to walk the ENTIRE park. There should be one or two \"shortcut\" trails for situations like this. I wouldn't have minded the long walk - it's good to get exercise - but it was annoying in this situation.\n\nAnother complaint: you can't bring bags on ANY rides, so you need to pay for a locker. If you don't want to pay 50 cents every time you go on another ride, you can keep your stuff in the same locker, but then you are without everything and have to run back to it every time you need something. VERY annoying.\n\nUltimately we had a great time and the rides were good (one or two were great), but we don't feel the need to ever go back.",

Even when we weren't hungry.  The only place I would recommend eating is the BBQ place. \n            We did the day Sarengeti Safari for an extra charge that we enjoyed so much that we came back for the Saturday night Safari tour.  The night tour is a small group with tour guides( Go Mori, Charles and Gabe you guys were awesome)  who take you to various animals.  The keepers are there feeding them so they're right up front.  The lions were my absolute favorite.  The night tour is 21yrs+.  You start with FREE beer and a picture with the tour guides.  Take the picture that comes with your package too!  There is also a camp fire that everyone gets around to tell stories.  At the end of the tour you get desserts and hot chocolate.  \n             There is also a bird/animal show that has scheduled hours.  If you can make it go!  It's free and a lot of fun.",

It's like a giant zoo with animals from mainly Africa with a few roller coasters thrown.  I went on 2 of the roller coasters and maybe it was because it was only in the upper 60s/low 70s but the wait for both rides was less than 10 minutes!  Loved it!!!  Also paid extra for a Safari which included a ride on a flat bed truck out to see the antelope, zebras, rhinos, giraffes, and plenty other animals I now cannot name.  The highlight of this safari was getting to feed \"Becca\" the giraffe lettuce.  Plenty of Budweiser influence in the park with the Clydesdale's and the Bud & BBQ area.  I tried some BBQ ribs and they smelled better than they tasted.  If you are over 21, you get 2 free drinks (Bud products naturally).  They do not give you tickets or punch a card or anything so if you don't have much of a conscious, you could probably drink your admission (there is only a sign asking you to adhere to the 2 drink policy).",

Congo River Rapids was closed for improvements, so only two open water rides and it was a really hot day! The \"Iceploration\" show was really nice.\n\nThe best part for me was all the animals! One orangutan was trying to tighten the net he was resting on, it was so cute. The other orangutan seemed so sad which in turn made me sad. One elephant was having an awesome time cooling off under the water sprinklers. I won't keep going on and on about the animals, but that is the reason I gave this park 4 (4.5) stars.",

We checked locker prices and they were 18 dollars for the day. When we returned her hand bag to the car, the rides had closed down due to inclement weather. The rides remained closed down for the rest of the day. The weather was cloudy, with no rain or lightning. They even closed down the animal attractions. The only parts that were not closed were the food stands and games that costed money. In conclusion, we paid all that money to walk around a closed amusement park. I had thought they would try to redeem their customer base by offering a discount to come back another time, but that is not the case. I will not be going back to get swindled again.

The lines are pretty slow because there are not enough staffs working and it is inefficient.  \n\nThank god for the military  passes.  I certainly don't wanna pay 100 dollars for this place. So for that, I give Busch Gardens an extra star.",

      "text": "Theme park and zoo heaven!\nThis is hands down one of the best zoos in the country and I've been to several top flight zoos including the National Zoo and Cincinnati Zoo. \nThe rides here are GREAT. I may be biased because I lived in Tampa, and my boyfriend's dad works here, and am a pass-holder...hummm  \nLove Montu, my favorite ride of all time. Ride this in the front at night. I dare you not to duck your legs or scream! Sheikra always gives me butterflies in my stomach and I've ridden it about 50 times. It is always a rush and always awesome. Kumba never get old either and is a pure ge force giant! Cheetah Hunt is quite fun, and is even better at night! Gwazi is rough, but personally I like it. The Phoenix is a crazy looping Viking ship that I personally love. I always think I'm going to get stuck up-side-down, which is part of the fun! \nYou will get WET on the Tilalwave water ride. The log flume ride is good ol classic fun, and Kongo river rapids is a classic tube ride (warning, you can get very wet on this too. This one is a real gamble). \nThe animal exhibits are beautiful, and very up close and personal. You can pet kangaroos and wallabies! if you go on the Sunset safari tour you get a cold beer and can feed the giraffes! This was an amazing experience. It was on the pricey side, but worth the money!The Jungala tiger enclosure is crazy insane and you can walk into a dome and usually there is a tiger next to it or sitting on top if it!  Lots of tropical landscaping, waterfalls, and even performers on stilts! The scenery is great. There is always something to look at. This park beats Disney's Animal Kingdom hands down! \nThe Kinetics Summer Nights show is cirque du soleil worthy and the music is great. Iceplorations is a lovely and top-flight ice skating show and a must see. Madagascar Live is so cute and great if you love the movies as I do! You can get your picture with the characters after the show. \nThe Holiday events Howl-O-Scream and Christmas Town are very good as well, and a great way to get in the spirit. I enjoy both of them for different reasons, but riding the coasters at night is the highlight of both events! \nLots of kiddie rides and things to do for kids.\nAll in all a beautiful park, and a must do if you are one of the following; in the Tampa area, a coaster fan, an animal lover, a show lover.\nOn your next Orlando vacation, it may be  an hour out of the way but is totally worth the drive and the theme park price! I'll always be a huge Busch baby!",

There are several food options, including restaurants and concession stands.  \n\nThe park has most of your standard amusement park attractions--though I don't recall seeing a Ferris Wheel.

The ticket prices were a little steep even though a majority of the rides were closed, but the entrance fee includes all six haunted houses and you can ride a few of the roller coasters and thrill rides.\nThe haunted house were pretty great. They didn't do the normal clowns, zombies, and chainsaws. While those things were within the haunts, the haunted houses had more unique themes like Death Water Bayou, The Black Spot (pirates), and Insomnia. All of them were great but Motel Hell was probably my favorite. The lines weren't too long for them either. We did buy the fast pass and wound up not using it for half of the rides or haunted houses. It seems like once midnight rolled around the park was empty and the lines had no waiting.\nWe had a really good time and loved all of the rides. We were a little disappointed that Cheetah Hunt was closed unexpectedly, but we will definitely be coming back next time we're in town.",

      "text": "Used to come to Busch Gardens just about every year growing up but this was my first time coming as an adult (21+). Outside of the beer garden and the cheetah hunt ride, the park hasn't changed much since I was here 8/9 years ago.\n\nAlthough it was hot and humid, I still had an amazing time. I came with a large group and we had fast passes so we were able to ride almost every ride while also being able to stop for drinks/food at just about every corner with the all day dining/BOGO drink package.\n\nFirst, let me talk about the food/drinks because I feel like that is at the heart of most yelp reviews. My favorite thing to eat in Busch Gardens is the ribs at Zambia smokehouse near Shiekra. I cannot express how much I love them. There is nothing more that I look forward to when I go to Busch Gardens than shoving those savory pieces of meat that I firmly believe are cooked by God himself. However, I was very disappointed to learn that the \"all you can eat\" package specifically EXCLUDES this entree. Not sure if that was always the case, but unfortunately I had just spent $35 on the package and didn't see a need to spend another $20+ or so on the ribs.\n\nAnyway, the package does include a BOGO drinking perk. Every beer that you purchase entitles you to another beer. So you can get two beers for $9 which I think is a pretty good deal. After a few beers and a meal or two, you would have made your money back and some (CURSE YOU ZAMBIA).\n\nMy favorite rides growing up were Montu and Kumba and now that I am bit older and wiser, I was able to objectively evaluate the two again. I think it's fair to say that the two are the best in the entire park. They are are fairly long and full of sharp twists and turns that make up the long waits. Although I knew what I was getting myself into, it almost felt like a whole new experience because it has been so long. You almost forget how great the two rides really are. Be wary of Montu as it is a bit extreme and might catch you off guard. Towards the end of the day, my girlfriend and I decided to ride Montu back-to-back because there was no line and she came out feeling very nauseous and with a pretty strong headache.\n\nOverall it was a great time. Had a ton of fun even though it was my 10th+ time going. I am not giving this theme park a five star review until they add the ribs to the all you can eat dining package.",

There is a humane part of me that just wants to break all the animals out and hold their paws on their journeys back into the wild.\n\nBut that part of me only came out after I was gone and mulling over the experience. While I was there HOLY CRAP WE HAD SO MUCH FUN!\n\nWe went on Christmas Eve, so your mileage will vary considerably. I would have had a different experience if I'd had to wait in a line for any more than six seconds, but I didn't and it was awesome.\n\nMy girlfriend screams like she's being murdered for most of any roller coaster ride. It's hilarious. We rode Montu enough times, back to back, that she was yelling in a way that seemed more appropriate for signaling to family members that she had indeed come out of her coma. The highlight of our trip was when we rode Shikra twice in a row. That is a very, very intense 200 foot vertical drop you have there, Ms. Shikra. \n\nWhat's great about the park is that you can break up the exciting rides by seeing all these cool animals you never get to see, and vice versa, when you're bored of giraffes and alligators and tigers, you can challenge your bravery on super-fast and crazy vertical roller coasters. \n\nBut I sure am glad I'm not a hyena.",

      "text": "We visited Busch Gardens today as a group. I brought my dad, my sister, my husband, and 3 friends. This is going to be a rather long review, but I hope to cover all the areas of our visit. \n\nI am a huge fan of the passport pass with Busch Gardens. Upon arriving, only I had a pass with admission for the day. My husband purchased a passport pass (for Busch Gardens & Adventure Island), we purchased one for my sister (with her upcoming birthday), and one of our friends purchased one too. My father and other friend purchased a funcard. During this month if you buy a Busch Gardens funcard, you get Adventure Island too. The perks of having a passport over a funcard? You receive parking for free, as well as other perks year round. You receive free $10 giftcards every few months, a ticket for a friend during the month of your birthday (how my third friend came), extra discounts on tours, BOGO deals, all sorts of specials (they change each month). No other park I've held a pass at gives special rewards like these each month. They are nice little surprises that make you feel appreciated.\n\nThe tram was busy, so we decided to walk. It was truly a short enjoyable walk for us, not more than 1/4 mile. Once we arrive to the front we got in line to purchase our tickets. There are plenty of kiosks available, if you can do self-service you can use these. You can also purchase dining bands and quick que passes there. We got in line with all the passes we had to buy. We waited about 15 minutes and were ready to go into the park. Security check was simple and fast. It you bring food, skip using tupperware... You can't bring that in, we heard someone else.\n\nWe purchased Dine All Day dining bands for 2 of us. We personally felt it was worth it, for the water bottles and snacks. They have changed their dining bands recently, so be ready for changes. Now you can get 1 entree an hour, and they scan. You can get unlimited drinks (including bottled water), salads, fruits, and desserts. They also now need to ring your items up, and scan your band. Annual passholders receive discounts on these, so they are very affordable. If you plan to eat twice, they are worth it. Now with your band you get BOGO on things like dip n dots, churros, popcorn, beer (yes BEER), and other various snack cart items.\n\nYou name it we ate it! We ate at Dragons Grill, for lunch. My favorite is the warm cherry/apple tart they make, but I couldn't find it today. We had dinner at the smokehouse, and that was delicious! The lines were a little backed up. But I really think it is people learning the new band system, and spring break crowds.\n\nWe took our time, and spilt up since we had so many people. Yet we felt very accomplished with our visit today. We visited several shows (Opening Night Critters, Motor City Groove, Treasures of the Mirage, and Iceploration). All were great, my favorite is the baby elephant in Iceploration. We also rode several rides (Kumba, Cheetah Hunt, Monteu, Falcon's Furry, and the train). I am not a huge fan of their new locker system. They ran out of lockers at Kumba, and it was a long wait for a locker... We ended out having my husband hold the bags so we could ride. Busch Gardens will not let you ride with bags for safety purposes.\n\nMy Husband and I did the Elephant's Insider tour upon first arriving. This tour with Noel was a truly awesome experience! It was very organic and real, which we really appreciate. Not a song and dance, and misrepresentation of what daily tasks are. We felt involved and educated on what they were doing right in that moment, as if none of it was \"planned.\" Knowing how such beautiful and large creatures are cared for while being able to learn neat things hands on is great. I encourage this tour for all who love elephants. It was an additional cost after admission, I thought it was a very reasonably priced tour ($26 per person w/ annual passholder discount).\n\nWe visited the kangaroos, and fed them for $6. I wish we got more lettuce than other things like pellets and hay, because they are only interested in the lettuce. I appreciate this exhibit, it lets you interact and pet them up close.\n\nOverall Busch Gardens is a great experience. They really do deliver a great day at the theme park.",

      "text": "Being from Miami, we have visited Busch Gardens 2 years in a row, and in my very humble opinion, one of the best parks nowadays!!!\n\nWhat we like is you have everything there:  an excellent zoo, attractions and when hunger strikes lot of choices to eat...And every now and then if you visit in July/August (like we have done) there are plenty of places to get some refreshments for the kids and for us the adults, few beers as well!\n\nCompared with the overcrowded and overpriced Disney parks, I perceive at BG you get much more for your hard earned bucks...Of course get ready to walk (get your most comfortable pair of sneakers) and sweat since after all this is FL, but the experience for the whole family is unique and really one of those moments that live in the household memory forever!\n\nFor us FL residents I strongly recommend you to get the 'food pass'; you pay about $35 to $40 per person but you can eat limitless in most of the eateries at the park...And not only it means a free food with beverage and dessert:  if you are in a mode to have a few beers either at eateries or any of the myriad of kiosks throughout the park, on those you get 2 x 1...What else can you ask for? I feel a little sorry when see those tourists from South America spending $80.00 for a tray full of food when I walk besides with another and perhaps bigger food tray with two 16 oz beer cans or aluminum bottles and after seeing my food pass badge the cashiers announces: '$7.50'...You should see the expression in the faces of those poor tourists!\n\nAbout the eateries or restaurants I specially recommend you the Zambia Smokehouse...The meat there is simply delicious and made to perfection!\n\nWith all honesty BG is really an entertainment park and if you visit Tampa make at least day and a half to get there...Despite how fast you walk, in a single day you do not cover the whole park...Also strongly suggests you to stay after dark for their fireworks and shows, both are great and really worth be seen.\n\nMaybe the only drawback that if it is a thunderstorm nearby the park area, then attractions get into closed down mode...During our visit two years ago it happened once and although it reopened after just 1 hour, if you are in a tight time schedule might be a disadvantage...But I also consider the park must first and foremost seek the security and well being of its patrons so really have no objection to it...We spend that hour at the Serengeti Overlook, my daughter and BF eating some food, my half orange and yours truly sipping couple of beers each at its cozy and relaxing bar!\n\nMake yourself a favor, visit Busch Gardens!!!!",

For $36 bucks you can go on a safari adventure and explore many endangered species. Short lines and not bombarded with impatient tourists. Busch Gardens was a breath of fresh after braving Walt Disney World. Also happy that Busch was open on Christmas day. Beer was very fresh. I did expect more beer stands around the park but can understand why there wasn't because Busch no longer owns it. Overall two late twenty-somethings had a blast!",

      "text": "Busch Gardens Tampa is amazing! We were there for two full days and utilized the Quick Queue on day two. Although the price is high (varies daily), it was worth it. We were able to ride Cheetah Hunt (our favorite coaster in the park) 10 times the second day. The Serengeti railway train is a MUST (a 40 minute trip all the way around). You gain fun facts from the funny tour guide and you get to see lots of animals without splurging for the safari. The park offers a diverse group of coasters that are high quality. Although we are coaster lovers, we had to check out Falcon's Fury. At over 300 ft tall, it is a must for those that love high thrills. Another thing to check out is the Cheetah Run that is over near the entrance of Cheetah Hunt. You get to see Cheetahs run across their habitat. It's quite the sight! Get there early so you can be up front by the fence. The park is filled with different types of animals all ages will enjoy. The theme is compatible to that of Disney. Lots of small details to look for. The food isn't overpriced and pretty good for theme park food. The Zagora Cafe in Morocco has a lot options, including vegetarian which is nice. The southwestern veggie wrap is very good. They offer healthy side options such as a piece of fruit or baby carrots. The staff is friendly and helpful all the way around. There's a free tram from the parking lot to the entrance. We would suggest booking a vacation package through the Busch Gardens site. We booked ours with the Hyatt hotel about a half mile from the park; definitely worth it. Can't wait to check out Busch Gardens Williamsburg!",

      "text": "Average large theme park. Unfortunately, some of these places cannot handle large crowds during the holidays. I hate paying so much money to spend so much time in lines. I was going to give 4 stars, but 2 rides shut down for a period of time which means we wasted time standing in line or walking all the way to those rides. And we waited in line before the doors opened for a show and just missed getting in to see the show because the theater filled up. There weren't that many people ahead of us. \nWe did get a great deal for tickets and meal plan. We are 2 adults and 2 children (although one is considered an adult at 11 years old). We all payed the adult with all day dining plan price - which through AAA was $99.99 per person. AAA does not charge tax or fees. All day dining at that price was worth it. Food is great for an amusement park. \nOne other annoying thing...people who bring in their own food and make a mess eating while standing in line. A large group from an Eastern European country was eating cheetos and made a mess throughout the line - they left a trail. There needs to be better rules...maybe no eating in line. And the no cutting line rule needs to be enforced. 2 people shouldn't be in line for a 1/2 hour then the rest of their party show up and cut the line. So annoying! It was a fun day though and the kids had a great time. In the end, that's all that matters to me.",

The time I was here however the air ride stopped and we were stocked in the air for over 20 minutes.

      "text": "It was my first time at Busch gardens today. The only thing I knew about the park was that 1. It was owned by Seaworld and 2. There are often power outages. I was disappointed that parking was so expensive. 22 dollars for an uncovered lot? Cmon. Anyways we purchased the all day dine tickets on the internet so we paid 105 plus tax and got to eat and drink once every hour. I was highly underwhelmed by the food at Busch Gardens. The Zambia smokehouse brisket was like beef jerky. Very dry and cold. The chicken and the sausage were both okay but the chicken was dry. The carrot cake is okay, not great, but decent. The french fries were the best thing I had while there. \nIf you have a wrist band it's BOGO beers, including craft beers! That was a huge plus in my book since it makes each beer about 4.50. I was a little bummed when I walked up to the entrance and 2 rides were listed as closed. As I walked through the park looking at the animals I realized none of the rides were operational. There was a power outage and the rides were closed for quite some time. When I was able to ride rollercoasters I was pleasantly surprised at how short the lines were. The park as a whole was relatively empty. I will say Montu, Cheetah Hunt, and the Shieka were my favorite 3 rides. Cobra's curse was boring and short. The inside waiting area was neat though. The Shieka kept breaking down throughout the day and I'm not sure why. I was also in line for the Montu 30 minutes before closing and they shut it down for \"technical difficulties.\" It just seemed like the rides kept breaking and were inconsistent. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I LOVED the animal exhibits. I was not expecting to see so many animals! I was able to see the animals closer than I have in any zoo! White tigers, hippos, kangaroos, etc. they were all great. I wanted to do the safari in the truck but it's an extra fee to do. :( I feel like that should have been included. Overall, I was surprised with Busch Gardens and would go back. I'm just glad the park was empty and we could walk right up to the coasters",

So, plan in advance -- especially in peak season when the lines are line. The park also has a lot of animals. So, if you have a teenager and a pre-schooler, you'll still be fine.\n\nDinning in the park is pretty limited. Check the show schedule. They offer shows AT dinning area. I also love the turkey legs. They are classic! \n\nThough Busch Garden is a great amusement park, I think the single day ticket price is way too much. I believe they set it so high to encourage you to get multi-day and multi-park passes -- which are much more reasonable.",

FINALLY we get to the park and get on line to buy tickets. ONE HOUR just to buy tickets. more than half the people on line couldn't read english,only Spanish. They're 8 kids per family couldn't understand English either. 80 dollars later...I stand on a 25 min line to get 3 beers for my friends and I. $25!!! For 3 beers? Anyway, at least we were in the park ready to have fun. To our surprise EVERY ride AND haunted house is a 3 hour wait we decide to go on falcon fury in fear that we wouldn't have time to ride anything else. We were the NEXT ones to have our turn \"technical difficulties\" is announced for the ride! BS! Now I'm mad and back on line for another round of $25 beers for just 3 beers. After 5 min of planning we decided on shikra it was mathimaticly the only ride at this point that we could go on before closing. We wait 2 hrs on line. Were next to go on and AGIAN \"this ride is having technical difficulties\" we wait additional 30 min and FINALLY when on our first and last ride of the whole 5 hour evening. In short, I spent $130 to go on 1 roller coaster in the course of 5 hrs....there's WAY to many people moving into Florida! This never happened from the time I was 5 to 13 years old. WTF happened?!",

Christmas town is awesome if you have a little one the wait for Santa might be 45-90 min wait depending on the day but the experience is so worth it. They make you feel like you have your own private and special moment with Santa and Mrs. Clause and they don't rush you out like most places do. Also free cookies!!! There's so many activities for the kids and play lands and then of course free beer and roller coasters for adults. What's not to love. If your not a local I don't recommend staying in a hotel close by because the neighborhood is sketchy but you defiantly should stop by and check it out. Parking is $20 but that's standard at any theme park these days.",

      "text": "Wow!  Busch Gardens sold me per the ticket:\nLength of stay ticket with All Day Dining.\nI stayed for 4 nights and paid over $1,200 through Busch Gardens Vacations for budget hotel Hampton Inn and Suites.  Looked like an ok hotel until 2nd day when dead German cockroach was in bathroom (not a palmetto bug).\nThe cockroach was the icing on the cake as that day Busch Gardens told me that my tickets \"Length of stay ticket with All Day Dining\" only had 1 day of dining!  The night before I had noticed the first card given to me (which you get when you turn in your voucher at zone A) said only one Day Dining. I went to the service desk.  I was told by the Busch service desk that every day I needed to come up for that days dining ticket.  I was told the kiosk people did no know the system you had to look at the voucher number to read it correctly, but that everyone knew about this at the customer service desk and not to worry I had dining for every day due to what I purchased.  \nThe next day, no one knew.  Not only that Busch Gardens customer service desk in the park now said Busch had nothing to do with the ticket or hotel as 3rd party sellers (hotels) offered packages on their website where I purchased it, which was Busch Gardens Vacations!!!!  \nOn the bottom of my receipt it said sold and serviced by Busch Gardens Vacations.  I showed the \"supervisor\" she said no that's not true you have to clear this up with the hotel.  You really can't make this stuff up.  \nI was starting to feel like Chevy Chase in Wally World. \nI called the number on my ticket receipt, and googled Busch Gardens Customer service.  No resolution. Numerous emails.\n Seriously, if they are correct it seems the way they named this package was deliberate, unfair, and deceptive business practices.  Oh, the funniest thing I was told was that if the Dining included was for more than 1 day the ticket would have read \"Length of stay ticket with All Days Dining\". Not correct English.  Really????\nThe food is pretty good.  What they resorted to in order to sell it to me is awful. The park and hotel are in a really sketchy area.  Told by front desk in hotel not to go out unless we took transportation as it was not safe.  Wow!  I was sick of Disney, but it is just looking better and better.\nUPDATE- Busch Gardens honored the length of stay all day dining.  They sent vouchers for the days I was owed mid-day on 12/25.  I am changing my stars from 1 to 4 as that was the only problem I encountered.  Roller Coasters and animal interactions are amazing.  \nFood on all day dining is good.  Being able to grab a bottle of water anytime at no charge is great, BOGO snacks nice.\nThe best food is found on upper floor of the Serengeti overlook restaurant.  Absolutely delicious turkey dinner on Xmas, not part of all day dining, buffet style, no beverage included. $26.99 per person",

They shut down rides until the storm passes for the safety of the people, which I appreciate. Unfortunately, if thunderstorms persist, they don't give you a voucher to come another day so choose wisely when to visit. The day I went, there were also quite a few full trash bins, and I get it, a theme park gets busy but after waiting almost an hour to get on a ride and then get off the ride to see the same full trash cans was kind of unpleasant. Other then that, it was a fun time! Rides are as advertised and gift shops are clean!",

The prices are a lot less exorbitant than prices at Disney and the park and atmosphere is more laid back. You can walk around and enjoy the animals and exhibits or go crazy on the roller coasters if you're into the rides. \n\nThere's a tram to take you from the parking lot to the park. There used to be free beer school and unlimited beer if you were smart to hit up a variety of the bartenders but I believe you now have to pay. Darn! At least now I'm not running to the bathroom every 10 minutes from all the free beer. :)\n\nFun park for adults and kids. A lot less crowded than Disney and overall more enjoyable in my opinion. Fun decorations around Christmastime, too!",

      "text": "A solid 4 stars as the park has a little something for everyone...  While not as famous or as glamorous as its counterparks ;-) Busch Gardens delivers a fun all around experience.  For the adventure seekers, there are plenty of roller coasters to choose from, the waits ranged from 10 to 45 min, depending on the time of day and I last went on a Sunday.  The earlier you get their, the shorter the wait times are for everything (A somewhat obvious point that it is often easier said than done).  The one disappointing thing was the train (Serengeti Railway) that runs through the park is closed for repair and won't reopen till 2016.  It was something we found out only once we got there, no signs at the ticket counter, but is listed as close on their website. Having been to Busch Gardens years ago, I did recall the Railway was a cool train ride.  In terms of value, if you're local to Tampa Bay or fairly close, it makes sense to buy the Fun Pass or an Annual Pass instead of 1-day admission.  They've added enough special events that it makes it worthwhile to go 2-4 times a year.",

We went early in the morning and didn't have to wait at all really, we rode the good coasters over and over. Compared to Islands of Adventure in Orlando, the Busch Gardens Tampa coasters are most intense and more of them.

My daughter refused to go on the floor and walk on her own (which she has been doing since she is 11 months and now is 19). I told him several times she can walk she is just being shy. And he continued telling me she needed to walk herself in. He was not at all understanding or friendly. I kindly told him 'I cant force her to walk\" and he did not understand or allowed her to ride. I talked to the manager in the area and didnt allow me either. She has been on that ride over 10 times and never has walked inside the ride on her own. What if my daughter was dissabled or had developmental delays (which she does not have)? That means Busch Gardens will not allow dissabled children on that ride?   \nI also recommend that employees who work in the children area (Sesame Street) at least have some kind of understanding of how children behave.",

If you have kids I recommend getting the fun card for themand one adult getting an annual pass.  Annual passes are less that 20 a month, you get 10% off of everything, special pass member offers (bring a friend for free during your birthmonth, buy one get one free food, and much more) and you get free parking (which is 20 dollars), so if you go once a month or more you save on parking alone.  Park has rides for all ages, pre-K and up.  My 6 year old is able to ride 5 roller coasters (cheetah hunt, sand serpent, scorpion, flying grover, and cobras curse).  Food isn't too bad, but you can always leave the park to eat and come back (I would recommend if you do to eat on fowler or fletcher, the restaurants on Busch Blvd are always being closed down by health inspectors).",

      "text": "I haven't been here in over 30 years. A lot has changed.  The animal area seems so much smaller. There are a lot more roller coasters. The Quick Queue was well worth the extra money.  My brother, son & I had minimal wait times at all of the coasters. \n\nMy dad had a blast. He did find a rest & recharge station to plug his scooter in for a quick recharge. \n\nWe were disappointed in the photo key. There were no park personnel out taking pictures in the park other than when you walk in. I say it is not worth the extra money. \n\nThe map of the park is terrible. You can never figure out where you are or where you need to be (I read maps for a living) . The downloadable app for smart phones is just as bad. If you click on an item it should take you to a map that is understandable. How about using GPS mapping? \n\nOverall is is worth the trip if you like amusement parks.",

Both of these paid themselves off within ONE ride/meal. \n\nWe did get lost trying to find our way back to an elephant insider tour and unfortunatley missed the tour, but the park was generous enough to refund us our money. I also HIGHLY recommend the serengeti safari... a giraffe LICKED MY FACE!!! So cool. (Yes I cleaned up afterwards) and the Common Zebras were beautiful! \n\nOverall, I loved my first time at Busch Gardens and loved seeing all of the animals from the kangaroos, to the lions, and even the huge variety of birds :)",

      "text": "Love coming here with my family and friends.  The best days to come are during the week, no lines and the ride attendants will let you ride multiple times if there is no line! Our 4 year old is able to ride The Scorpion and The Cobra's Curse rollercoasters, as well as the river rapids, the flume log and ubanga banga bumper cars .. She is 43 inches tall, the requirement for these rides is 42in and on couple of occassions we were told she wasn't tall enough and had to explain she has been on numerous times, on one occassion we even had to ask for a supervisor which was a little frustrating but she was able to get on and all was well. Our favorite place to eat is the Smokehouse located by Sheikra, I highly recommend getting the all day dining pass if you are planning to eat more than once during the day, this allows you to get food once every hour including dessert, unlimited drinks and my husband's favorite.. buy one get one free beers ($8 a beer), dipping dots/funnel cakes etc. We enjoy all of the shows the park puts on. I love the Opening Night Critters in Pantopia theatre and our daughter loves the kiddie show in Sesame street. The Dragonfire grill also has lovely shows all of the time. My absolute favorite rides are Montu and Sheikra, hubby loves Falcon's Fury (I am too chicken) and Cheetah Hunt, which is awesome! The little ones get in free up to 3 years old and there is plenty to do! The Sesame Safari of Fun has many kid attractions, as well as an awesome bounce house our daughter loves! If you are coming with little ones I definitely recommend you take a left in the beginning of the park and start out with Sesame Street where most of the kiddie attractions are. See you there!!",

They have a lot of thrilling rides like Montu - you hear people screaming for their lives at every corner.  The smaller ones like cheetah chaser, 2 water rides and the trolley that passes over the zoo were fun.   I enjoyed the little safari and we got pretty close to the rear end of a rhino on that one.  Its a big area and they have lots of species of birds and animals.  Food and water is a tad expensive like at other amusement parks.",

My experience coming to this park was as a complete novice. Parking was $25 and filled up quickly! They don't seem to have enough handicapped and/or preferred parking. Come early if you fit into either of these two categories. I like that they have a tram system to take you from the parking lot to the park, however, I had a large stroller and there was no space to put it on the tram without taking up space for other riders. So we walked about 15 minutes to the entrance. At the entrance, as a first timer with annual passes, we were made to wait in line at booth B. I estimate that we waited in line for at least 1.5 hours!!! And we got there around noon. The park opens at 10am. I suggest to go early if you're trying to redeem your printed online passes and free kiddy passes! \nAfter we got our passes we were able to quickly go through security! A plus that there is a metal detector! The guards also look through bags! Good!\nOnce in the park, it was a joy! The only thing I didn't like was that to exit the park once you're ready to go, the options of where to walk is extremely limited! There's a good supply of bathrooms and rides! \nI had a good latter half of my day there! I recommend.",

It felt a little circus themed because it is a tent, colorful lights go up the ceiling and the cocktail tables all lit up different colors, with some of them having colorful balls as centerpieces. They had multiple unique catering stations set up and served a signature cocktail in a cool light up cup. They had a sloth and performers come in throughout the event. You can do a lot with the space, I recommend checking it out for large events/receptions/parties. We also got free admission into the park after.",

      "text": "I grew up in Orlando and, oddly, Busch Gardens was the theme park with the most cache and that my friends and I loved.  Maybe it was because it was more of an adventure driving over to Tampa than to the other side of town or maybe it was because Orlando-Metro schoolkids went to every Orlando theme park on field trips all the time.  For me personally, I think it was the animals and rollercoasters. Long before Islands of Adventure or Animal Kindgom, Busch Gardens was THE place to go.  I celebrated a birthday here circa 1986, came over on day trips in high school, had an annual pass all through my college career in Sarasota, and have continued to love this park after settling in the Tampa area.  I think there are three or four main reasons Busch Gardens has withstood the test of time and why it has been a solid FIVE star experience for me for nearly 30 years.\n\n#1 - The Animals - Busch Gardens Tampa is African themed and has an amazing collection of animals from around the world.  The animal exhibits are immersive and tucked into the Florida landscape making the park experience one of exploration and discovery for guests.  The park is laid out in winding paths and little nooks and around every corner there is a new exhibit or animal showcase.  I had a lovely day at the park with my (then 80-something) Grandfather where the only things we did were the animal exhibits and shows.  It was a full and fun day and we really enjoyed checking out all the exhibits.  One of my favorites has always been the \"caves\" - an area near Crown Colony with bats, snakes, and all sorts of awesome creepy crawlies.  I also really appreciate Busch Gardens commitment to education and conversation.  They had natural and large exhibit spaces long before that became the standard and the animal shows have always been very well done.\n\n#2 - The Rides - While there are other parks with roller coasters now, Busch Gardens still has the claim to fame with the most varied and largest number of coasters in Florida.  Many may not remember it now, but Kumba was the first monster steel coaster in Florida, Montu was the first inverted, and SheiKra was the first with that thrilling death drop.  As time has gone on, Busch Gardens has phased out some of the more carnival-type rides (which makes me sad) and the amazing monorail (not so much a ride as a great way to see the Serengeti animals but still awesome).  But they still have the SkyWay buckets, the train, and a few other classics.  Timbuktu still has a number of cool, smaller rides like the Phoenix (the upside down ship) and cool, spinny things (the Sandstorm?).  \n\n#3 - Great Deals for Locals - Busch Gardens has kept their pricing competitive against the big boys in Orlando, but more importantly, they have offered the absolute best deals for Florida Residents and locals of any of the parks for over 20 years.  With Annual Passes only $10-20 more than a 1 Day Admission, BG has kept me coming back again and again for special events like their concerts and amazing entertainment options.  (Can I mention how mad I am at myself that I never caught the Dance/Tango show before it departed for a still continuing run on Broadway?)  It seems like Disney, Universal and the rest draw so many tourists that they have not always been good about offering great deals to keep locals coming back throughout the year.  Sure, there are whole collections of parks up there, but I still don't have $400+ per person to blow on passes with tons of exclusions and blackout dates and no good options for free parking.  \n\n#4  - Smart Park Design - Busch Gardens is a compact little gem but the best thing about the park design is that it is NOT a sea of endless concrete.  Florida only has 2 temperatures - hot and \"OMG, I'm dying it's so hot\".  Unlike any of the other parks I can think of, BG has always had trees, shaded spots, and the cooling help of water rides and misters.  It seems odd to wax poetic about the beauty of smart Florida landscaping, but BG does a great job of presenting a living, breathing, growing park experience with lovely flowering plants, trees, and native foliage.  I've found it to be the most pleasant of the parks when it comes to walking around all day.\n\nOverall - BG is still my top pick of all the parks.  Good rides, wonderful animal exhibits and pretty good food for a theme park.  Word to the wise - Always eat at the Crown Colony Restaurant (not the cafeteria downstairs).  Sure, lunch for one will run you $16-20 with tip, but two words make it worth it - FREE REFILLS.  After a few times of sitting on the shady verandah overlooking the Serengeti exhibit, guzzling glass after glass of iced tea while giraffes wandered by - I was hooked.",

Anyone that has a child with autism understands that this is not helping whatsoever. Autistic children don't understand or tolerate waiting or crowds. We would get a time and return at given time only to turn us away because the ride was closed. This happened at least SIX TIMES. We arrived at the park at 10:00 amand by the end of the evening only rode 3 rides the entire day because they kept turning us away. We spent over $300 to ride THREE RIDES. Needless to say we will not be returning to Busch Gardens.",

I understand that it is slow season and there is maintenance to be done and new attractions to build, however, it would be nice to be made aware of this upon entering park. In addition to this, two different drink/food huts had items sold at a different price as advertised. When asked the reason for this deception I was told by one employees that the prices had gone up and it(the sign) hadn't been changed in forever. While all together I only had to pay a whopping 5 or so dollars more than shown, it's was the lack of consideration I found most annoying.",

You will also be charged a service fee for online and phone purchases. I only learned all this after changing our annual 3 park passes to Platinum passes.",

This is definitely a family park with a fair amount of rides for old and young. The parks rides are not as modern as some of the popular parks but still a great place to have fun.  We were able to see most of the animals and ride the big attractions.  We did purchase the food card for a discount of purchases in advance.  The food was terrible and it was a complete waste of money. Unfortunately even in June the park didn't open until 10:00 am and closed at 6:00 pm.  Most of the restaurants didn't open until 11:00 am and closed at 5:00 pm.  We found it difficult to take advantage of the food, ride the rides and see the animals.  If you are considering food pass please consider the hours of the park.  Other than that we had a great time.",

The reason for 3 stars, we had a group of guys cut in front of us to join some friends after we had already waited over 45mins. Other people reported it to staff and they said that they will call a supervisor. The group began harassing everyone they cut so another person went and complained again. Finally a supervisor Lexxie came we explained what happened, she went and talked to them. One female turned around and said your stupid to some ladies in front of us, some of the guys were even giving dirty looks to all of us behind them. Of course they said they were already there and made some excuse. She did nothing basically and said sorry. Why post signs about cutting when you do nothing.",

The were being sucked in and then pushed back out by the current and water pump. After a very very lame and 20 second attempt to capture the ducks in a net for safety, they proceeded to run the ducks over with the next raft in order to keep the ride running. Since this was a family friendly ride children and adults alike were witness to this event and then saw the dead duckling bodies floating away. We immediately left after telling park customer service what had happened. I will never go back and will be sure to tell anyone who mentions Busch Gardens. For a park that claims to help animals its pathetic that this has happened. Even small non endangered animals should matter. Sickening.",

I will say that I am as definitely bummed I couldn't ride anything cause they all looked great. \n\nI did get to see the ice skating show and the \"critters inn\" show and both were cute. I also enjoyed all the animals I got to see. \n\nThe only other thing I did was eat. There's no food I would recommend as it was all your typical amusement park food and nothing was \"good\" although I didn't have anything that i would call bad. What I would definitely recommend, though, is the all you can eat pass which allows you one entree, a drink, and a side or a dessert once an hour. This is definitely the best way to go. It must have saved me $60 at least. You also get unlimited drinks.\n\nWhat I would not recommend, though, is coming here while pregnant. I came to Florida with nine other people and most of them really wanted to go. Thankfully my husband and his sister don't like rides so they kept me company all day and we went and did the above mentioned. I would say if don't like rides or can't enjoy them - save your $100+ and go to a zoo or something. But if you're not in that group - it might be worth it.",

      "text": "Hands down 1 of the best family vacations you will have. There is something for everyone to enjoy here. \n\nThis was my 1st trip to Busch Gardens Tampa. Having visited the location in Williamsburg,  I decided this was the perfect plan to celebrate my daughter's 5th birthday.  We stayed nearby with Family just outside of Tampa so lodging costs were not a issue. The park is just 30 minutes from our family's home. Tampa can come off very comparable to some areas of Miami and East New York in  Brooklyn once you arrive. Busch Blvd has alot of fried chicken restaurants, Beauty supply stores and pawn shops. Don't let that discourage you. \n\nOnce you arrive in the parking lot, I advise you to park in Area C or F for Flamingo. This will be a easier walk once entering and exiting the shuttle buses. The shuttle buses will bring you over to the main entrance of the park. If you're smart youl have purchased tickets by using your AAA Discount prior to arriving. You are greeted and asked to scan your ticket and be finger scanned into their system. There are no tacky wrist bracelets. Once you get into the park, I advise that you board the Serengeti Express Train for a full tour and easy access to all areas of the park. The park is African and Asian themed. \n\nThere are areas if the park designated for children and the rest is for teens and adults. There are family rides such as the sky ride and sand serpent roller coaster. The Sesame Street Safari themed park features Sesame Live Theatre, Water areas for the small ones equipped with tipping buckets and sprinklers. No water rides. This is something Busch should consider. Bring on the water slides. I was disappointed that the rides were so limited for the younger crowd at Sesame Safari. My daughter enjoyed herself regardless. The Air Grover is a safe and fun roller coaster for kids under 7. The take photos of you while you ride. TIP: sit in front for a good shot. \n\nThe rest of the park features beautiful landscape, wild animals and thrilling rides such as Cheetah Hunt, Cobra ' s Curse and my favorite Sheikra!!!!\nA coaster that sends you upside down around and through water. Even onlookers get wet!!!!!!!!\n\nThe food here was very good. Be sure to buy a souvenir cup for free refills throughout the day and try the craft beer and fresh pretzels in Pantopia. From BBQ ribs freshly charred on wood fire to chicken salad. They have it all.",

      "text": "First visit to the park.  In this review I will provide you with Pros and Cons.  Cost was per person $100 and parking $25.00.. just for a visit to the park came to $225.00.   There is a trolley/train that takes you (free of charge) to the park from the parking lot.  This was great because the entrance to the park wasn't that close by.\nWe arrived as soon as the park opened which we are so glad we did. Once the crowd rolls in - long lines etc. Arriving early gave us time to explore the park. I loved the bird watching and all the charming landscape throughout the park.   Sheikra was the first ride. No purses even little ones- must put in a locker which was close by. The lockers are close to the rides but a big pain in the butt.   I get the reasoning but I purposely carried a small shoulder/sling bag which nothing would have came out of it on the ride but rules are rules.   Sheikra was a blast.. dive coaster.. loved it!! I recommend the front seat.   Since it was early there wasn't a wait for the ride which was great.  We then walked around and decided on the Sky Ride.. which are those cable cars that take you from one area of the park to another.   I am afraid of heights and it wasn't too bad I was able to ride it.  By the time we got off that ride - all the rides had long lines all ready and it wasn't even noon!!!  We decided to wait for Cobra's Curse.. the wait was only 60 minutes which was shorter than most. There were a lot of children in line so we were thinking the coaster might be more mild.  Its pretty neat though - when you get into your car - you are taken up by an elevator lift and then down little hill and the cars spin - you aren't facing forward. Then the cars go backwards.  It's a different type of ride - but was over in less than a minute.   The going backwards part made me sick to my stomach.\n\nPROS:  I loved the shops within the park and enjoyed picking up some souvenir items.  The park is well taken care of and its enjoyable just to walk around.  I liked the fact that restrooms were all over the place.   The Trolley that pick you up at the parking lot is nice since you have to pay $25 to park at least you get something out of it. \n\nCONS:  When it came lunch time.. we couldn't find a place to eat that didn't have over an hour wait?  I would have settled for a soft pretzel at stand or something but there wasn't much offering food- a caf\u00e9 and the main hall near the entrance to the park.  The lines are insanely long.   this really annoyed me. We had to leave early before we starved to death.   I gave up and we even waited a little bit at the caf\u00e9 but the line didn't move!?  I could see the food in the distance but wasn't moving. Why on earth is there only a few places within the park to grab a bite to eat! ?? It was packed - and so crowded.   It was an expensive trip to the park and we didn't even get a chance to experience the food because the lines were crazy long even to eat.    What about a gyro stand or sell soft pretzels - something?  \n\nIts great that maps of the park were provided to help you get around but they weren't entirely accurate.  We kept feeling like we were trapped.. and things didn't appear as they should of according to the map.   That grew old - and annoying real fast.  \n\nVisiting this park made me miss my good old hometown amusement parks in PA...  you don't have to wait an hour to eat!",

He was not helpful in any ways and his name was Edgar. He was extremely rude to us. It wasted our 2 hours. We drove 5 hours from ga, last night and had to drive back after park but apparently it was after 12 and still no resolution. After we went inside park and went to safari counter that lady took 2 seconds and was able to locate our booking. Kids were very upset (age8,9 and 13) that it took us longer to go inside and and not having enough time inside the park..",

      "text": "Okay so first of all this was our first time here traveling with s 14 year ild; 3 and 2 year old. It was about 90 degrees. Getting to the park we hit normal amount of traffic as we approached. Parking situation was a hot mess there's about 6 windows to pay for parking but it turns into 2 lanes of traffic with very little guidance. I have preferred parking they claimed there wasn't any but we walked by there and there were about four rows empty. We parked in the back where the first tram stop is parking like Disney but not a lot of guidance people were parking wherever. Asked the girl trying to guide traffic where the park was she said less than a mile from the parking but I could ride the team. Being that the tram is tiny and there were tons of people and we had a double stroller we elected to walk. The walk was ok not to bad there was some shade it was almost 11 am. Went through security and ticket scan quickly. Walked in then it's about another 10 min walk to the Sesame area which was our first stop. Stopped for our first refill of the day the soda machine was broken. This was the stand next to the ride which looks like little jets. The huele as very nice and we for icee. Walked to the Sesame Street area it's ok few kids rides with short waits but the rides are very old and ugly looking. Only a few kids are allowed on at the same time so it takes forever. The Sesame Street characters walked through the street and that was cool for the Kids. They rode all the rides and the bouncing thing which my two year old was to short for and he's 34 inches. We did all those rides and then we went to ride the train to see the animals. The train is not great it was very slow and there wasn't much to see. I would have rather walked and looked at the animals. The guy who narrates the train ride was not knowledgeable and not interesting. The animals were cool my kids enjoyed them. The food we did not have but we refilled a ton because of the what. All the machines were out of ice I stopped in four different locations no ice. The places all smelled rancid it was terrible. I would never eat there. If we go back I would only eat at one of the nicer restaurants. The staff also needs to be trained better there are many many people there that have no idea what's happening.",

We decided to leave Minnesota for Florida on a Thursday and go to Busch Gardens on the next day before heading back up to Orlando for the rest of the weekend to round out another park. My husband spent forever planning the perfect day in December that would have low wait times and be an overall great experience for us. WRONG. We showed up on Friday to be apologized to by every single worker we encountered because it was \"Physics Day\" AKA THOUSANDS of teenagers taking over the park. There was NO warning on the website as we planned our special day. Every ride we went on had smelly teenagers groping each other and making out during our waits in line. It was so disappointing. Even the restaurants were full of children.. it was like being in a high school cafeteria. We have been to many theme parks but I've never seen something like this. We finally bought the safari tickets for 30 minutes away from the teenagers and it was the best 30 minutes of our day. Thanks for the warning, Busch Gardens. The employees' multiple apologies spoke for themselves.",

Of course you have to pay for parking which stinks but it feels like the norm now. We went on a Saturday and the lines and wait times for rides weren't unbearable as they can be at other parks. My only complaint is they definitely need to install more fans for those waiting in lines. Food and drinks are over priced too so try to be strategic.Their variety of roller-coasters truly makes the experience worthwhile. Can't wait to go back!",

      "text": "Came with my non-ride oriented family. It was OK. Part of a package, so no major loss, but would probably not do it again. We lapped the place in about three hours. Here's some random thoughts.\n\nBusch gardens Tampa is squeezed into the middle of suburbia. Be aware that you will park in another block, due to the roads, and take a tram in. Allow for the time and be aware of the impact if you want to lunch away from the $10 fried meals. In the off season, one tram worked back and forth, so it took a while.\n\nThe park had a lot of great animal enclosures. The cheetah run was awesome. They really run! Most standard zoo fare is there. Did the rhino run which was pretty cheesy. Way too many scripted puns with little enthusiasm, way short, not much wildlife. They cut out parts some of the riders enjoyed a few years back.\n\nThe kids loved the rapids, but again nothing new there. Little maniacs also enjoyed putting in quarters to squirt the riders. However, they don't mark the jets to the buttons so watch someone first or plan to waste your first investment.\n\nThe advice here about the maze is really true. They make a significant effort that you don't easily find your way. Forget about even trying to find your way by map. The map will show one thoroughfare which is really a series of different paths. Go ahead and download a GPS Busch Gardens Guide. There's a free one that was amazing. The GPS enabled map was a god send. Even tracked ride times. Not really helpful to us, but maybe for you.",

Easily saved the extra cost in parking fees and time wasted waiting for the tram. \n\nI've done all the theme parks in Florida, but with the exception of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Busch Gardens is my favorite as a Florida resident. If you are willing to go on non-peak times, it's a quick walk to the front of the line for most rides, and the Halloween event is much more user friendly and affordable than the Universal Studios event which is way too crowded. \n\nThe food, particularly the Zambia Smokehouse is very good, and you get a lot of it for the price--only Dollywood in Tennessee has better values. \n\nLove feeding the Kangaroos in the Australian section, and if you arrive in a slow day, you can get up close and personal with the various animals in Jamba Junction.",

All of the rides had less than 10 minute wait time for the majority of our day so there was really no need for the \"quick queue\" option on our tickets.  We opted for the online ticket purchase with an \"all day dining\" option that was around $15 more per ticket but it was well worth it.  If you eat one meal at the park while there, it pays for itself.  The kids had a great time at Sesame Street and thoroughly enjoyed the safari train ride viewing many of the park's animals.  Of all the theme parks we've been to over the years, I have to rate Busch gardens near the top on the overall experience.  The fellow patrons were not rude nor portrayed entitlement as we've seen elsewhere.  The employees seemed friendly and helpful, I'd venture to say they enjoy their jobs!

They have 250 different species of animals, many which are endangered, in a free range habitat area that alot of folks don't even bother going to see.  Living within a 20 min drive, I've been to this park many times over the years.  And I've enjoyed the shows, the themed events, Hollow scream, Christmas Town, the live shows etc, but I still love seeing all the African animals.  I think they have more animals than Lowry Park Zoo.  \n\nI miss the old days when they were owned by Anheuser Busch and gave out free beer, enjoyed by many on a hot summer day.  I especially miss the Clydesdale horses, as that was always one of my favorite things to see in the park.  \n\nMy favorite ride in the park is the Cheetah Hunt coaster, a very smooth ride!  There are several water rides to cool your jets when the temps and humidity soar through the roof.  \n\nThey do allow water bottles so be sure to bring one.  The food is pretty standard fare, the animals seem well cared for and the humans are in abundance.  \n\nThere are many different options of tickets, if you are an out of towner and plan on visiting multiple sites, check out the City pass for some of the best deals out there.",

Overall, the experience was disorganized and many rides were not opened. \n\nFalcon Fury was supposed to open earlier this year & it has yet to open. The wooden roller coaster was closed both days we went to the park. \n\nWhen rides were open, the organization was lacking. Workers would let you through the entrance and this is where the organization ended. Riders went into whichever rows they felt like and people had to figure out how to manage riding with family members in different lines. If workers didn't allow so many people through at once, the system would work much better. \n\nMy favorite ride was the Cheetah. It did not make one queasy but had quick bursts or speed with a few loops. Another exhilarating ride was the Sheikra. This ride takes you up, hangs you off the side, then drops you at 90 degrees!",

What can I say that hasn't been said before or will make ANY difference whatsoever with respect to how many people visit this park?\n\nBUT...here's what I liked and didn't like, if anyone from management actually reads these reviews and GAS what I think (or what any reviewer thinks):\n\nLIKED:\nYou can save $20/tkt if you buy online.\nFrequent trams \nOpening Night Critters: AWESOME!\nThe shows are generally good\nLOTS of animals to see (the cheetahs are my favorite)\nFood is generally good\nShops have a good selection (I bought an awesome cheetah mug)\nBathrooms are cleaner than one would expect\nLines were short. Moved along at a steady pace\nAll employees were nice\nMost things are easy to find\n\nDISLIKED:\n$18 to park.  NO NO NO NO NO. STOP IT.  It should either be FREE\nto park or, at the MOST, $10. STOP BEING GREEDY.\n\nLet people stay on the sky ride to get back to the area of the park they started the sky ride in, rather than forcing them to get off and stand in line to get back on.  We were in Pantopia and wanted to do the skyride just to do it and also to get some photos. We wanted to come right back to Pantopia for the critter show. NOPE. CANNOT DO IT. Must disembark near Egypt and stand in line to get back on to go back to Pantopia.  PLEASE STOP DOING THIS.  IT'S INCONVENIENT AND ANNOYING.\n\nCongo River Rapids:  I was on this ride with 7 other people.  Only 3 people sitting together got soaked. The rest of us barely got wet. EVERYONE who rides this ride should get SOAKED.   LAME ride anyway.  Too calm, needs to be rougher.\n\nThe motown show is decent (the singing mostly) but needs to be improved. If you're going to have a bunch of people singing motown songs and dancing, add some scenery and lights and spectacle. That show needs a technical kick in the ass. Also, the asian guy on guitar is BORING. The other guy isn't much better.  They need to get into it more. You're not playing in the lounge at the Holiday Inn.\n\n\nThis is a good, fun park and I would recommend it to anyone.  But I think some improvements would be nice for everyone.",

I saw the same group(Yellow class of 19 shirts) trampling over people. Ran over older people and a person in a wheel chair. There was no need to run as fast as possible and push people out of the way to keep up. Cussing and inappropriate talk as loud as could be. Very, very bad experience with a child. Will not return. Try out Aquatica, Seaworld and Discovery Cove! Got them all as a package(including Bushe Gardens) and enjoyed them all. Went to Aquatica about 4 times now. Plan at least one more visit.

The Food & Wine Festival is awesome and a great deal if you purchase the sampler lanyards.",

      "text": "Its quite interesting how this park evolved from beer promotional tool to a one of most the popular amusement park. We were here for 2 days and definitely needed the second day. During our visit toward the end of August I think they had just changed the hours of operation. Unlike Universal in Orlando they only opened from 10-6 even on weekends which was a bit of a bummer. Especially the weather at the time was always chaotic, the first day we visited maybe had torrent rain in the afternoon for couple of hours and most of the indoor shows we tried to get in were already filled given that this is primary an outdoors amusement park, they also seem to a bit slow in getting the rides back up once the rain stops.\n\nHowever, they did have a 2 day admission for single day price around $80 online when I was booking my trip definitely helped offset the bad weathers and shorter hours. Below are the attractions we were able to visit in the 2 days here and of course spoils warning :)\n\n-Rides \n\nCheeta Hunt - By far the most popular ride while we were here, being that its closest roller coaster to the entrance and the longer ride time. This was the only ride where we had to wait more than 10-15 minutes. Definitely very fun and fast and does not drop very far making it more about speed than altitude. Unfortunately this ride was also the one with most problems. Twice while we're were waiting in line they had malfunctions and was not able to fix in short period of time. I would suggest visit first thing in the morning or before the park closes.\n\nSheikra - To be honest I was bit worried about the drop when I first saw the photos. Its definitely quite a nervous wreck that first time hanging by the ledge waiting for the drop. I would have to say first row does make quite a difference as you can see much more below you while waiting for that first drop. Much shorter ride time after the drop though but also shorter wait than the Cheeta Hunt. However this was the other ride we rode that encountered mechanical problems.\n\nFalcon's Fury - We came to try this after Sheikra and at first I thought I was crazy to try such a high vertical drop. Again like Sheikra at the highest point it pauses for a moment and actually tilts the seat facing downward for you to see everything below! Quite an adrenaline rush indeed. The brake comes in approximately about 1/3 of the way toward the ground so its really only couple seconds of free fall if you're worried about the duration haha\n\nKumba - A bit rocky and bumpy ride compare to Cheeta Hunt, its located towards end of the park so much shorter lines. Compare to the flagship rides its a bit underwhelming but I think still fun\n\nScorpion - A much milder coaster compare to the other big boys, although it did go around 360 degree though I think this can be passed if you're stressed for time\n\nCongo River Rapids - I'm not much fun for these water rides and this one wasn't much exception haha. Bit run of the mill raft ride with chances for people outside to spray you with some water. Glad this time it was sunny and my clothes dried quicker.\n\nSeregenti Railway/Skyride - Both are great ways of getting awesome and scenic views of the large Serengenti open field plain that takes up 2/3 of the park. The train ride takes more time obviously but you get some nice photo opportunities. Definitely highly recommend to do both to help cutting down the walking time.\n\n-Shows\n\nIceploration - My favourite indoor attraction and definitely a great way to rest your aching feet or avoid the rain. Very beautifully done stage and props with some animal actors included in the show! Even if you're not a fan of ice skating shows I think its worth it just to see the colorful and vivid arrays of costumes and arts.\n\nOpening Night Critter - Its a very fun and cute trained animal show. In addition to the usual cats dogs and birds they even brought in a pony and kangaroo at one point. Perfect for kids and adults for some light-hearted humorous show.\n\nMotor City Groove - We stopped by before leaving the park since the show time was right at 5:30. Quite talented singers and actually involves bigger crew than I thought with the band and dancers\n\nIn addition to the rides and shows the park also hosts a wide array of animal exhibits making this place a zoo and amusement park combined. I did notice the animals here definitely seem much more active compare to regular zoos. Plenty of chances to see them feed animals with guides answering questions. They also have a pretty big animal/vet center where you can actually see what goes during checkups.\n\nThe food here were pretty sub-par and the staff at the entrance does seem more strict about letting outside food as they check the bags more thoroughly compared to Universal but it could just be depending on the person. Despite some mechanical and weather setbacks overall the visit was great. With some proper preparations definitely can be a great memorable time here at Busch Gardens.",

I was disappointed with the customer service of ride operators. Many were disgruntled and rude to us patrons. In the middle the kiddie log flume in Sesame Street Land the operators had a disagreement about their lunch break and who's would be covering it. Many other ride operators and food services workers were rude and what seemed displeased with their job. My daughter loves Elmo and whole cast did a wonderful job with the show/meet & greet. I am also disappointed at the traffic into the park. They need more bag check in kiosks and/or extra security to move guests more quickly into the park. Please remember to save yourself a little extra money, packing a few frozen water bottles. Fun theme park for those who can ride many rides, leave your newborns at home!!!",

We took advantage of the later summer hours and so ate a couple of times and snacked. The all-day dining deal was well worth it. Bought one for each adult (family of 4) and we got the platters which had plenty of food for us and our 2 kids, who like to eat. We had a great time. The wait times were not bad for the rides. We got there early and closed it down. Did popular rides first and it was fine. Had a great time and we'll go back.",

Plenty of shade and places to rest as well as shopping and dining to keep me occupied as I am not a big fan of roller coasters and more. Lines we not too long and my son and sister were able to most of what they wanted as far as rides go. I did go on the Congo Falls, the only type of rides I really don't mind doing. Yes, I got soaked. We spent most of the day here and only called it quits when my son go a little nauseated after too many rides. Parking is not too bad and they have trams that run from the park to the lots every ten minutes or so. Also, the park is not ridiculously huge but not small either. I was able to explore without getting tired or sore the next day... plus I got a lot of steps in! I scoped out some of the Food and Wine booths, that were not open (we were there on a Friday and F&W is Saturdays and Sundays only) and I was surprised by a lot of the offerings. (4 Ice Wines to get is double what is available at Epcot F&W.) The park is clean and there are a lot of warning signs that signify disruptive behavior isn't tolerated.",

I don't recommend going on busy days, as you will wait in lines all day, but when you pick the day just right, you can avoid large crowds and quick wait times for rides without a quick queue pass. I definitely would recommend the All day dining pass! You will save lots of money on food this way, and get unlimited drinks all day, you can't beat that. Had a couple encounters with rude employees who didn't seem to care about the experience of guests (mostly at the food spots.) As a young adult with lots of energy and adrenaline to burn, this place is perfect to bring a group of friends and jump on and off roller coasters all day. For the cherry on top, to relax in between rides, it's really fun to experience the animals!",

The Safari Train will not be operational until sometime in 2016, so the only way to see the animals in that area of the park is from the Sky Ride or take the Safari Adventure - an approximate 30 minute open truck ride costing $30/pp.  You do get to pet and feed a giraffe, if they approach the vehicle. (Pavlov's conditioned response...they associate the truck with food, so they show up). Didn't find the \"guide\" to be overwhelming knowledgeable; was rather boring. But the giraffe was beautiful.  The big cats were out and about.  Plenty of shady areas for cooling down. Concessions are ridiculously overpriced, but which parks aren't?",

The rides are need to be updated and painted.   The food is awful and expensive.   The animal exhibits are fair but we have an amazing zoo in our town so others may feel differently.   If you are planning a trip my suggestion is to do Sea World, Aquatica, and Discovery Cove.   In my opinion it is a better use of time and money.

      "text": "My two favorite things are animals and amusement parks and this place has both! \n\nBusch Gardens participates in the \"Waves of Honor\" program which allows active duty military members to enter for free once a year and bring up to 3 family members free of charge.  Kudos to you, Busch Gardens, for supporting our troops!  So generous! \n\nVisited on 12/22/2017 and we got there about 30 minutes before the park opened.  If you have kids and a stroller I strongly recommend telling the people who take up the money for parking and they'll give you a special tag to put in your windshield and you can park right in front of the entrance.  (VIP status, yo!)  Parking was $20 and they take cash or cards.  \n\nThe park is pretty big and it's nice-ish.  It ain't no Disney but at least it's clean and has plenty of employees.  Prices are outlandish but that's to be expected.  There is money-gouging at every opportunity but that'll be no surprise to anybody.  \n\nWe had my little nugget with us so no roller coasters but there was plenty to do between seeing the animals and playing in the huge children's area.  Be sure to ride the train that goes through the animal park and the ski lift thingy cuz those were both awesome.  My kiddo loved walking through the bird habitat and feeding the parrots.  For $7 they'll give you a tiny cup of nectar and the birds go ape shit for it.  \n\nMy favorite thing in the park was the show \"Opening Night Critters\" which was indoors in a nice air conditioned theater.  The show itself was cheesy but they had about a hundred animals doing tricks and I almost lost my mind.  I found myself squealing with delight more than once.  Definitely do not miss this show if you love animals!  \n\nAll of the food I tried was very *meh* and incredibly overpriced.  If you are a bottomless pit like a camel like I am you wanna get the souvenir cup because the refills are just .99 cents.   We ate at the \"Dragon Fire Grill\" because it's like a big food court indoors and there's a ton of tables and a show playing while you eat.  We ate rotisserie chicken and watched a wonderful Christmas play and I loved it.  \n\nIt was definitely way cooler than I expected.",

      "text": "I grew up near the Orlando area, so for most of my life I was only familiar with Disney and Universal parks. That being said, if you are looking for more thrilling attractions, then Tampa is where to be. It is still very much a family-oriented theme park, but the roller coasters are unmatched in the state of Florida. My personal favorites are Kumba, Cheetah Hunt, and Cobra's Curse. If you are looking for more intense thrills, I would recommend Sheikra and Falcon's Fury.\n\nMy favorite part about the park however, has to be the animals. The park does not look that big from the outside but once you are inside those walls, there is way more space than expected for the animals. Of course it is not as good as the wild, but they seem content. I really enjoy walking around and viewing each exhibit. There is even an overlook near Cheetah Hunt where you can view many of them in wide open areas. \n\nI've been a few times since moving to Tampa which means I have been able to visit during their holiday/ special occasions. I highly recommend their food and wine festival during the spring time. We did not get the food passport which was a big mistake on our part. The food really adds up and with the passport you are able to keep track on how much you spend at a time. I have also been to their \nHowl-O-Scream event and their Christmas town event as well. If you like Halloween Horror nights at Universal, but do not like the long waits and expensive tickets, then I think Howl-O-Scream is a good alternative. It is cheaper and the lines are not as long (also you can ride the rides during and you have a better variety in my opinion). Their Christmas town is also a nice alternative to Christmas at Disney. Of course it is hard to compete with the House of Mouse, but I think Busch Gardens puts up a good fight. Also as a nice surprise, when we went to Christmas town it did rain and some rides closed every now and again but Busch Gardens has a policy where if the weather affects your visit you can go to customer service and get a free replacement ticket good for a year from the day you visited. \n\nAll in all, if you live in the Tampa area or you are visiting, do not sleep on Busch Gardens. It just might be the alternative to the rather pricier Orlando parks you are looking for!",

Which is okay, but what wasn't was the fact that there was a worker sitting inside the dog kennel waiting area on the phone. The worker never even asked if we needed help. \n\nSecond, when ordering food and drink refills. Workers would not know answers to questions about the menu. Workers chatting with friends would blatantly ignore customers, etc. \n\nIf you want to fix Busch Gardens, fixing the customer service is a must.

We stood in line and not once, not twice, not three times, but FOUR times we stepped up for our turn to a window after the last customer stepped away and they turned their sign around and said they were closed and to go to another window. They were very rude and would just simply point to their sign instead of helping us. Once we got in to the park it was very hard to find our way around. They only have maps at the front entrance so don't forget to grab one on the way in. The signs were very vague and we had a hard time finding the things we wanted to do. Stood in line for rides and they would get shut down due to technical issues. The roller coasters were average, the ones at SeaWorld were better. Definitely not worth the money we paid for tickets. Parking is also $25 FYI. We will not be returning here",

I used to go to see the fireworks when I was here as a kid. I will note, usually newer rides have a longer wait time but you can get on Kumba and Montu very quickly since they've been around for awhile. Cheetah hunt and the Serpent ride will take a bit longer. The wooden roller coaster is gone sadly but I think they're replacing it with something new so that's nice.

Dirty and wet all 5 times I needed one. Doing the whole day between buying waters. Beer. Nasty funnel cake. Ice cream. T-shit and other thing no one of more than 12 encounters with employees was nice. No one from the staff had any education. None of them wanted to be there. Not even a hi after spending all this money. In general a very dirty park. And really bad staff. And nasty food. I know 10000 better way to spend my money.

From the food, to the animals and roller coasters to the customer service....it was a great day!\n\nWhen me and my party arrived to the park it was storming. I was surprised at the number of people that were at the park. We didn't have to pay the $22, for parking which started our day off nicely. \n\nI would highly recommend purchasing the meal plan with your ticket as it is worth the extra money! You can eat a full meal every hour if you like. Plus water is free and snacks are buy one get one free, which included most everything even beer. \n\nWe started off with a meal upon arrival since it was still raining. We took advantage of the rain and hit up all the animal exhibits the first few hours. Then once it stopped raining and there was no lightning for a certain period of time we were able to start riding the roller coasters. \n\nI had no idea Busch Gardens had such awesome roller coasters. We road them all, and two of the best coasters we rode again after dark. We saw a spectacular fireworks display around 9:30 PM. And we stopped by a snack bar on the way out and got our last free water and I purchased some caramel corn at buy one get one free.\n\nThe shuttle was nice too so you didn't have to waste your energy walking from the parking lot to the park. When the park closed the shuttles were coming every 1 to 2 minutes which was great! We even received a free ticket for another day within a year due to the inclement weather. What an awesome deal!\n\nThank you Busch Gardens for making my first experience at your amusement park GREAT!",

Pretty scary to look at, with the 90 degree drop I almost wussed out, but after some name calling by my supportive friend, I had to give it a shot!\n\nThe rest of the park is almost like a zoo...lots and lots of animals (turtles...YAY!!!) to look at and learn about.  You also have the opportunity to look at the famous Budweiser Clydesdales and Sprint, the Budweiser donkey from the commercials.  \n\nThe other couple roller coasters that I went on were really fun, as well.  They rode very smoothly, which is always a plus in my book.  You also have a chance (which I missed) to sample beer...for free...and become and Anheiser Busch Brewmaster.  I was really looking forward to this, but the timing was all off.  And we had a really small child with our group.  It makes me sad.\n\nFood is expensive and not great, so be prepared to sacrifice an arm, leg, and some other valued body part perhaps.  Or, snack throughout the day so you don't have to go for the full meal.\n\nI'd visit again, even if only for the free beer!",

      "text": "If you mix an amusement park, botanical garden and a zoo together you get something that looks similar to Busch Gardens.  Many opportunities for fun but also for complaints.  We think they do a great job overall.  \n\nHighlights, Tips and Observations:\n\nThere are several shows in the park.  We liked Turn It Up, an ice skating show teamed with pop music.  Great performances but also doubles as a much-needed respite from the sun and heat during summer.  There were four shows offered the day we visited.\n\nThere was a nice variety of animals and they looked happy and content.\n\nThe rides are spaced out throughout the park.  Expect a walk from one to another.  They're mostly geared toward the adventurous crowd that are at least 48\" tall and without health concerns.  You WILL get wet and/or soaked on water rides.  Renting a locker or bringing a dry bag for phones is a good plan.  We didn't find the stand-in dryers they offer for $5 as you exit to be terribly effective.\n\n The train ride moves around the entire park.  If you take it all the way around, it lasts about 35 minutes.  Yes, there are times when the ride is more interesting than others but it moves you through the park and is a great way to see much without exhausting yourself.  Also, staff members have been trained to wave as the train passes.  Littles that enjoy waving will have a blast.\n\nSerengeti Overlook is a good option for food.  If you need to eat, this is our recommendation.  I've written a separate review for their page.\n\nDespite the landscaping and gardens that are carefully maintained, much of the park remains in full sun.  They mitigate this as they can with misting tunnels and misting individuals (that is, people who walk around and mist guests).  Having said that, wearing a hat and sunscreen is recommended.\n\nBusch Gardens AND the parking lots are HUGE.  Paying for VIP Parking is a no-brainer (for us).  It gets you MUCH closer to the park.  Otherwise, your feet might feel like they're *done* before you get to the entrance gate.\n\nBusch Gardens is part of Tampa's CityPass.  If you can commit to visiting several attractions in a 9 day period, this is a great value.\n\nFinal Assessment:  Great choice for the entire family.  There's something here for everyone.  We're happy with our decision to visit and expect to return at some point in the future. 4 Stars.",

On the other hand, they lack options for non roller coaster riders, other than watching animals.  While I love roller coasters, I often get a motion sickness from rides with loops and a lot of turns.  I like straight rides with a lot of speed.   So to me, this theme park is a little too much and I would not dare trying to conquer all the rides.  And to be honest, the rides are very similar to each other and it gets boring after a while.  \n\nWhile I appreciate that I get to go on rides waiting for very little time, sometimes I feel this place is too empty and looks like it is going out of business.  They seriously lack options of dining.  \n\nThey have a couple of  package deals with other theme parks combined.

We got a quick queue so we were able to get on rides fast without having to wait which was nice because it was a little hot out. But I must say by far I was very happy that being a full figured woman I was able to fit on all the rides. That is the main reason this place gets high stars. \nFood was pricy as most parks are\nBathroom were clean think because we went on a weekday so not many people at park\nBut if your in Tampa and you like coasters this is a good find. \nIf your an animal lover dont go see kangaroos they looked very sad and not well taken care of. \nBut the other animals seem pretty good.",

The rollercoasters were all fun, especially the Cheetah, which uses magnets to shoot you down the track super-fast. The kangaroo exhibit was adorable (who knew that kangaroos had soft fuzzy noses?) and the other animal exhibits, like the tigers and elephants let you see the animals clearly and looked well-maintained, clean, and interesting for the animals. We bought a package from AAA that included 1 meal for $69.99 and ate BBQ at the Zambia Smokehouse. The food was better than the average amusement park stuff, although if you wanted anything other than the 1 included entree, the prices got steep quickly.  We didn't even have time to ride the train or do the Safari excursion, so I can definitely imagine going back.",

If you hate the hay smell, you'd probably skip this part.\n\nI was kind of scared of roller coasters.. it was all in my head till I got on those rides. My fave was Kumba. My legs felt so free, and it was good to experience the rush through my body.\n\nI didn't like Gwazi at all.. pretty rocky ride -- my neck and back started hurting. So did Ralph's.\n\nI am totally agreeing on drinking lots of water. If you buy a big cup with Busch Gardens, you can get free re-fills, even the next time you go there. If someone gives you a hard time about refilling it, go to the next one. We did and had to tell the person about the last person.

We did love the safari and Gabe the tour guide was awesome. A lot of the other attractions are extra as well and if u don't purchase them ahead of time, you won't have the opportunity to go on them since they sell out fast.

      "text": "Today was my first time going to Busch Gardens. We had reservations to the special event of LUNCH with Elmo and Friends. I was told on the phone it would be inside but be warned it is in an outdoor pavilion. The employee I spoke to was wrong about the set up of the facility. In addition it is self seating so therefore the tables were confusing. For example we were table 11 but there was another family that was also considered \"table 11\". Therefore it was a bit chaotic when different groups were meeting the characters. Personally I think each family should be assigned a number instead. \n\nThere was an outdoor cheer competition happening directly next to our pavilion. Their music was off the charts loud to the point you couldn't hear the person sitting across from you. Therefore the Sesame Street staff did the \"logical\" thing and tried to blast their music louder than the cheerleaders music. With 2 completely different songs playing at full blast it was absolutely horrible. \n\nThe food: The quality of the food was lacking despite my picture not showing the lack of flavor. It honestly tasted comparable to an elementary school's cafeteria. Someone in my group had a roll that was still clearly frozen. There was mashed potatoes, macaroni n cheese, rolls, veggies, chicken strips, pulled pork, salad, cupcakes, and fruit. I tried almost everywhere and was very disappointed. \n\nCharacters: First off there is no show during this lunch. I was misinformed over the phone about the entertainment involved during lunch. The characters dance for about 30 seconds. Don't get me wrong it is cute. However I wouldn't pay money just for a few spins. The characters were supposed to walk to one table at a time. However the staff wasn't facilitating enough as people kept approaching the characters, ruining the flow of meet n greets. Our table for completely skipped over by a character and I eventually had to go approach him since they were leaving soon. \n\nPhoto: The photographer lady wasn't very friendly at all. I wasn't thrilled with the quality of the photos taken. However 1 of them turned out alright out of about 5. \n\nFavorite character: The count was the best character there for sure. He was fair on the amount of time he spent with each family and I felt he actually invested time with my experience with him. I would've liked to have been able to meet the Cookie Monster or grouch as well. However there was no guaranteed characters except for Elmo. \n\nThe cheerleading music interrupted the entire meal and it was honestly miserable. The characters were cute but not $20 a person kind of cute. \n\nI went to guest services and they tried to work out some accommodations due to our poor experience. However I was not satisfied with how things were being handled. I ended up calling Busch garden customer service who attempted to tell me there was nothing left they could do. However I eventually was able to speak with Busch Garden corporate who took my complaints serious. We were able to work out something that I considered to be fair and respectful. The corporate employee I spoke to was kind, empathetic, and made sure things were made right. \n\nWhoever scheduled a cheer competition next to Elmo's special event lunch clearly didn't think through the logistics of sound. The food however does need help, especially for how expensive it was. \n\nI was very disappointed on my experience at Busch Gardens. However clearly corporate does care about customer satisfaction and is willing to take appropriate actions. \n\nIt should not have taken 1 guest service trip to speak to a supervisor, being put on hold several times with customer service for a good 30+ minutes, before FINALLY getting someone who could help me out. \n\nSo for now Sea World would be my go to place out of the two pairs. Busch Gardens has some growing to do with customer service and with their food.",

      "text": "My friend and I went here today. We spent six hours in the park and were only able to ride three rides. Every ride had over an hour wait. When I rode Sheikra, the operations were only running at 11 cars an hour, based on the monitor in the dispatch station. Other guests were frequently abusing the quick queue system. Several times I saw entire families enter the regular line and then climb under the rails to enter the quick queue line after passing by the attendant who was checking passes. Of the three rides that I did go on (Sheikra, Kumba, and Montu) there were consistently empty seats despite there being 40+ minute waits. In fact, most dispatched trains had 3-4 empty seats, but there were no single rider lines throughout the park.\nOn a more positive note, the animal exhibits were very clean and spacious. The park as a whole was lovely. There were lots of shady areas and everything was clean and well kept. It was a very large park but pretty easy to navigate. Much like Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, the park is essentially just a big loop. \nI have to say, though, that my visit overall was extremely disappointing. I traveled all the way from Connecticut to go to Busch gardens. Admission to this park was extremely expensive, and at the end of the day, I spent a lot of time and money to go to this park, which I was really looking forward to for months and had an awful time. My friend and I had planned to stay for the fireworks, but ended up leaving three hours early because we had such a terrible time. After spending so much money and traveling so many miles, it was an extremely disheartening experience.",

My son has a disability and could only ride a few rides-not that there was many! It was either the few kiddie rides which he's too big for or the rollercoasters (that wasn't even an option, lol) I know it's not a new park but dang nothing seemed to be working! Rides were down, one of the restaurants was not cooking hot foods just offering sandwiches. Also, the signs kept you (us) walking in circles. There are maps located all over but you still had to maneuver through diff areas to get where you wanted to go. I def got my 10,000 steps in The best part was the train ride up close with the wildlife!",

      "text": "On Christmas Day, we took a four-year old girl to Busch Gardens to give her something fun to do and try to accomplish something important in her life.\n\nFirst, we were impressed Busch Gardens waived all parking fees for the day as a holiday gift. This was not announced, just a very nice gesture for guests. We took two cars, so we saved $50 right there, and think about all the money Busch Gardens gave up for the entire day based on a pretty full lot.\n\nBecause we were letting a four-year old girl drag us around, we adults did not do the larger, thrill rides on this visit. \n\nShe stopped us at almost every smaller attraction and was clearly happy with all of the rides for children, whether she rode with one other random child or was able to ride with her mother.\n\nTherefore, we spent time in the Sesame Street section of the park as well as going to visit Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (She's a big fan) and friends for pictures. I was slightly disappointed Hermey the Elf was not there offerering dental \"check-ups\" and photos, especially since the American Dental Association gave him a dental degree for the show's 50th anniversary in 2014. Nope. Not making that up. Do your own Google search and see for yourself. \n\nShe also loves animals, so the big train out of Nairobi station that travels through the open area of giraffes, hippos, zebras and rhinos was fun for her as well. It is a Christmas Carol train after 5pm and those carolers do not let up.(She did not like the huge ostrich at all!)\n\nPlaying a choose your Christmas gift themed game with a guaranteed prize for just $6 and buying her a Christmas light headband for only $5 also showed us that the park was not trying to overprice little things that enhanced her experience. \n\nThe biggest move was visiting Santa's House to see The Big Guy himself. Especially on Christmas Day after he clearly put in a long night traveling around the world delivering toys.\n\nNot only was it the highlight of her Christmas, but all of us adults were extremely impressed with the details of the rather intimate experience.\n\nFor her first time seeing and meeting Santa, she did not deal with the usual mall chaos. She got Santa all to herself in peace and quiet, escorted by a Santa's helper through a magic mirror after a meet and greet with Mrs. Claus, who welcomed her as she entered the front door by ringing a cool doorbell. (The house looked perfect for the occasion and they only let in a few groups at a time)\n\nOurs was a truly authentic Santa and the room he sits in (Obviously, there are multiple rooms to keep things moving a bit) was lavishly decorated and spacious. There's clearly no rush and it is very quiet and intimate for the child to interact and take pics with Santa.\n\nEven after we all said thank you to Santa, the Santa's helper escorted us down another hallway where Christmas cookies were handed to us before we left the house. Nice finishing touch. Tasty cookies too.\n\nNone of us would have ever thought having her meet Santa for the first time in her life would be this good on this day in a large theme park. \n\nShe was really happy and obviously will talk about it and remember this for quite awhile.\n\nOur sincere thanks to Busch Gardens for making a four-year old girl's Christmas experience very special.",

      "text": "When you look at the distances between Disneyworld, Universal, & Busch, the latter appears to be the kid that doesn't get picked in gym class. However, I can draw at least 5 comparisons to change your mind about that:\n\n1. It took me 9 minutes to clear general security at TPA airport...I let my Trusted Traveler membership lapse (no fast lane for me\u200d). It would've taken over an hour to clear security in MCO. \n\n2. Park tickets on any given day at WDW & Universal are $100pp. No sales. Take it or leave it because they don't need your stinking money. Busch Gardens, on the other hand, has sales. We got 60% off our tickets.  \n\n3. FOOD! Oh my gosh, the food. We must've eaten 5 times in 1 day. On the dining plan, we could eat every hour, on the hour. An entree with a side or dessert. And the sodas were included to refill all day long without a limit. WDW & Universal have dining plans but even if you buy a full package, WDW starts at approx $100pp/day, and Universal $64pp/day, and there are dining limits. \n\nOUR DINING AND TICKETS FOR 1 DAY AT BUSCH FOR 3 PEOPLE WAS $267!\n\n4. WDW & Universal have character spots, but let's agree that these are grown adults in stuffed animal costumes and the exchanges are a little creepy for them and us. Busch Gardens has amazing shows with extremely talented people! We saw the Turn it Up! ice show and Critters Inn. Critters Inn features rescue animals turned into superstars. Someone saw the good in them! I might've cried a little during that one. There's several other shows but these are the ones we saw and they were outstanding. \n\n5. The zoo animals. Oh my gosh, we've been to San Diego & Houston's zoos and we saw more animals close up at Busch Gardens. And that was without paying extra for the interactive encounters. \n\nOkay so kind of #6, but only if you're a roller coaster thrills kind of person. I'm more of an amusement rider, meaning I like the the easy rides that entertain you along the way. This is where I prefer the other 2 parks. I can ride 2 of the stomach thumper 'thrill' coasters and that's it. Getting older sucks. BUT, that's when I walked over to the drink station, got myself an ice cold ginger ale and enjoyed the park views while my family got their insides pressurized & shaken up. It was incredibly gratifying watching grownups get off that ride looking woozy. It was a good thing I stopped early.\n\nAt the other 2 parks, you can ride or watch a couple shows. But the seating for non-riders is incredibly limited throughout those parks, so that explains all the annoying scooters. At Busch, if you don't feel like walking, there's the train and sky ride. If you don't want to ride the coasters, go for a walk through the gardens and be greeted by a lorikeet bird that says peekaboo with the cutest intonation. \n\nI'm not saying that WDW & Universal are bad..we're definitely going this year, but they're not the only ones that can help make the memories. If you don't rent a car, Tampa is only a 1 hour Uber ride from Orlando. That's the minimum waiting time for a ride at Disney. But 1 day of tickets & food at Disney will easily buy you 3 days of the same at Busch. We stayed at the Hampton Inn across the street from the park. \n\nAfter reading some of the negative reviews, I suspect those people might either be employees from competing parks or people trying to complain for free tickets. We visited on a Tuesday and had a wonderful time.",

You check in around 15 minutes before your scheduled tour (have to book at least 24hrs in advance) - There were 18 of us on our tour & you stand on the back of the truck. It was around 90\u00b0 yesterday so it was really hot, but feeding the giraffes made it worth it. \n\nIt is a 30 minute tour & the truck makes a couple of stops to see a few different animals but to be honest, that part wasn't very exciting bc you can see them at any zoo. The last part of the tour we were able to feed the giraffes. The tour guide gave us each a piece of lettuce & the giraffes came right up to the truck. There is a photographer on board who takes pictures you can purchase but we just used our phones. I would definitely recommend this as it was a really cool experience. I'd rate it a 10/10 just for the giraffe interaction",

I won't drag out this review and go through all of the changes but I really like the park now. Granted, I feel it was at its prime just a few years ago but I'm starting to warm to the new Pantopia changes. (Personally, I liked it best when the new Dragon Fire Grille was the German Festhaus and there was the whole Egypt and German influence) Anyway, the park is really large and I think it would be tough to do it all in one day so I recommend getting a seasonal pass - pays for itself in two trips. A couple of tips:\n\n1. Purchase the All Day Dining wristband. $30 but a seasonal pass gets you a discount on the band so it makes it close to ~$25. The bands get you all of the food you want to eat and BOGO drinks. \n2. Alcohol prices are different between the Dragon Fire Grille and the Colony House (weird, right?). Stick to the house if you want the lowest price.\n3. Bring your patience if you visit during Hollowscream.\n4. Enter the park and follow the path to the right and work the park in a big circle.\n5. The sky ride is notorious for not being open except for windy days - figure that out.\n6. Upgrade your ribs for $3(with wristband) to the baby back. They'll most likely fall off the bone.\n7. ONLY get the ribs at the smokehouse - not at the Dragon Fire Grille. They're always chewy at the DFG.\n8. Lastly, disregard the parking attendants if your arriving after 10am. Just drive up to the first lots as people will have left the park and you'll get a great spot near the walkway or trams.",

In my college years living nearby, buddies and I used to enter through the bird cages and get some free beer in the hospitality area...and then the beer was still brewed there. Then after the Serengheti Plains with more animals and rides were added, we took our kids there and it was a major thrill, but now quite equaling Disney for them. Adults appreciated the nature/animals emphasis more than cartoon characters and relentless promotion of Disney products.   \nMore recently we have not visited after kids have grown...and prices have sky-rocketed.  Nice you can get an all-year pass but not if you only want  to go once for old times sake.  So overall it is tops in memories and great as a Tampa tourist draw but not so much for repeat visits.",

She has come a long way from the Busch Gardens of my childhood and even further still from my parents childhood. While I miss the free beer that was discontinued with the change of ownership, I love what this park has grown into.  \nThe rides beat any Disney or Universal ride hands down, no competition. With a great variety of roller coasters, water rides and the Serengeti train, there is something for everyone and all ages. Although it doesn't spike your adrenaline like some of the roller coasters here, the train is a must! Where else in Florida can you ride a train between zebras, giraffe, buffalo etc. Although be prepared for delays because this train breaks for animals :)\nThe animals here, are in heaven. They have so much room and Busch Gardens prides themselves on giving the animals things to do. Don't be surprised if you see a lion playing with a ball or a gorilla opening gifts on his birthday. The Serengeti is huge, the zebras here don't even know they aren't in the wild. This is also the only place I know of where you can come face to face with a tiger or climb a ladder into a spy glass right in the middle of the enclosure. I highly recommend visiting the tigers in the morning when its not hot and they are feeling frisky! They tend to pounce on the glass and show you their teeth. Don't be ashamed to use your children for bait, because tigers apparently will come closer for bite sized kiddos. In the afternoons and in the heat, they get lazy and may not be quite as exciting.\nLots of dinning options, with anything you can think of. I love the Zambia smoke house and the Colony dinning room with family style all you can eat dinning. They also have a cafeteria show room where you can catch a show with your meal. Unlike Disney, No reservations required.\nThere are several impressive shows in the park that even adults will love but there is also a sesame street play land where you can catch a dancing Elmo.\nEveryone in the family will find something they love about this park.",

The older kids enjoyed the roller coasters. We had all day dine pass and enjoyed lunch. The first restaurant we went to was closed with broken water pipe. Park was crowded but kids enjoyed rides and animals. Went to Sesame Street show and the Turn it Up ice show. Boys thought the women in show were pretty and got a picture after the show. Everyone was nice and friendly. Overall had a fun day with the family!  Park was spread out so be sure to wear good shoes for walking and stroller for young kids. We got three day passes with all day dinning and also went to Sea World - Good Deal!",

The favorites were SheiKra, Cheetah Hunt, and Falcon's Fury and we still had time to get something to eat! we ate at the pretzel and beer place we had pretzel dogs and bacon pretzels too yum BACON!!\nThe combo of animals and rides is well done  with over ten different themed areas within the park, and more than a dozen animal attraction spots. the tigers and birds were my favorite. the gator pond was cool, you can really see how big those guys are!\nCool flamingo area too great photo op.",

We used to have an annual pass but didn't use it as often as we should have so we only go during Howl-O-Scream or a random day. It's an awesome place for a theme park and is very big in comparison to other parks. For days where we don't feel like dealing with Universal/Disney World traffic or lines, we go to Busch Gardens for our alternative and I must say that I've never been disappointed with Busch Gardens. They also have animal safaris and a lot of things to do there. It's always a grand time every time. If you are going during busy peak days and hours such as spring break, summer, Howl O Scream, I would highly recommend the fast pass because if not, you will not be having any fun waiting in those extreme lines.",

At the exit their was an Team member with a \"may I help\" flag.  He said don't go everything will be up in running very soon, he even gave us 4 fast passes.  Okay, sure we'll wait a bit, we'll another 2 hours go by & still no rides running.  Quite an expensive day to be cut so short. \n\nGreat customer service they contacted us & gave us 4 tickets to come back to experience the park & they don't expire for 2 years.

I've gone here at least 7 times this year and have normally piled into a car with an 'annual passholder' who gets free parking. Since parking costs $18 otherwise, this is a great setup and I will eternally thank my friend for it!\n\nThe coasters at BG are fanstastic (I recommend Cheetah Hunt, Montu, Kumba & Sheikra). And I must say that Falcon's Fury is much better than expected. Soooo smooth and offers beautiful views of Tampa. Not as scary as it appears. All rides have cubbies to hold your small bags, sunglasses and shoes. If you have a backback, you may be asked to lock your bag away at a locker to pick up later. The park is very shady with many trees and you probably wont have to worry about burning in the Florida sunshine. \n\nThere are several locations for beer/liquor if you like to drink and ride coasters. Our first stop is normally the Crown Colony Cafe next to Cheetah Hunt which is a great place to get craft brews or mixed cocktails. Another great spot is the pretzel place right by Falcon's Fury.  Water fountains are also located at all bathroom locations throughout the park. Such a great place to visit!",

      "text": "So this is the trip that every parent looks forward to for their child. A trip to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. My daughter and her class went there for the Halloween festivities. While she was there,  she purchased a bottle of water for $3 at the Tigris kiosk souvenir shop. She handed her $20 to pay for a $3 water and was given $7 back. I'm not saying my daughter's a genius but she knows that she should be getting back $17. There was a very long line and she was  hurrying so that she wouldn't hold people up. When she walked outside and looked down at her change she noticed that $10 was missing and that she had only gotten back $7. This also happened to her friend at the same kiosk with the same cashier. It appears there is a cashier at that kiosk who feels that it's okay to steal money from children because the children won't speak up or notice. I am so unhappy and disappointed about it, not just because a place like Busch Gardens shouldn't have that happening, but also because it left her $3 short of the breakfast money she needed for the next morning. I think it's really despicable when adults take advantage of children. If had only happened to my daughter than I would say it's possible it was a mistake, but she's 14 and she knows some math and it also happened to her friend who is also 14 and also knows some math. So that leads me to use my math and say one plus one equals foul on Busch Gardens Tampa and the cashier at the Tigris kiosk who was working there last night on September 27th 2019. Know that our family will not set foot there again. I really hope that someone from Busch Gardens Tampa will look into this and see what their employees are doing.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens is best theme park in Florida, and not just because it's here in Tampa, but because over the years they've done what other attractions around the state did not--adapt.\n\nIn the 50s and 60s, Florida was a sleepy state that relied on tourism for capital.  With the sweet allure of beautiful sunsets, white sandy beaches and great attractions like Sunken Gardens, Weeki Wachee and Cypress Gardens, the hope was to turn visitors into residents.  \n\nBuilt on a piece of land that previously served as Tampa's temporary international airport (Henderson Field), was Busch Gardens, and it was far from the theme park we know today.  It was basically a park with some benches and trees, and if one was interested, a brewery tour was available.  That was about it.\n\nThen came Disney.\n\nWalt Disney quietly purchased a ton of acreage outside of Orlando in a sleepy town no one had ever heard of called Kissimmee, and someone over at Busch Gardens started planning for the future.  In the years to come, rivers were dredged and straightened, natural watersheds were ruined, interstate highways were built and mom & pop roadside attractions on Florida's forgotten state roads began shutting their doors.  \n\nBut not Busch Gardens.\n\nMy first visit was shortly after my family was first stationed at MacDill AFB in 1978.  I can remember waiting in line for 30 minutes to ride the Mamba and the Gravatron.  And as I got older, rides like The Python and Scorpion were considered scary and insane.  As time when on, and as roller coasters became more advanced, Busch Gardens made the neccessary adaptations to keep up with customer demands.  Their foresight and ability to remain competitive with the larger parks in Orange County is, to me, why Busch Gardens is the #1 theme park in the state.",

I know you're thinking \" I bet the food was garbage and there is only one participating restaurant\" and you would be wrong!

Needless to say, I did not keep up with the changes in the past few years and arrived to find many of my favorites no longer in existence!  Gone are the sit down restaurants with full and tasty meal choices and replaced by fast food for the most part, with the exception of one open only on weekends.Gone are the variety shows that used to keep us so entertained and replaced with a more quick variety of entertainment.  Gone are the rides if you're not into roller coasters such as Tidal Wave and Rhino Rally which were favorites of mine. This park is no longer for seniors (my mom and now deceased dad used to have annual passes every year and loved going). The only part for small kids is Sesame Street Safari of Fun. My four year old grandson did not enjoy any of the rest of the park at all. This park has turned into a roller coaster park with fast food options and appears to be marketed for the 16-35 crowd.

      "text": "This was my first visit to Busch Gardens.  Nothing can compare to a Disney park, but this one is pretty close.  I visited with my daughter and her boyfriend, and our mission was to ride all of the roller coasters. February is a great time to go as there are very few lines and hardly more than a 10 minute wait.  The first roller coaster we rode was the wooden roller coaster Gwazi.  It was literally the best wooden roller coaster I have ever been on, it is fast and rickety!  We also rode Montu, Kumba, Cheetah Hunt and Sheikra.  Because there are no lines, we rode in the front seat and back seat of most of them. The park is huge and involves a LOT of walking.  The animal habitats are some of the best I have seen.  The tiger exhibit has a box you can climb up into, and the tiger is sitting on top!  That was so fantastic!! We turned our ticket in at the end of the day for a free one, but we were so exhausted by the end of the week (and all the other parks) that we just couldn't do the hour drive again.  This park gets a 4 compared to a Disney park because the employees are unfriendly and act as if they do not wish to be there, and the park is nowhere near as clean or well maintained as a Disney park.  But the roller coasters are excellent!",

      "text": "Was a season ticket holder for many years until just recently when they decided to cancel the two-year membership they used to offer.  No one from the park has ever reached out to ask why I (and my fiance) both decided to cancel after all these years.  The remaining one-year season program is just not cheap enough for someone who was averaging about once a month visits.\n\nThe park itself is great, especially if you enjoy amusement park rides.  They are generally changing things around every couple years to keep things fresh, which is one of the reasons why I choose the higher four star rating.\n\nThey offer concerts throughout the year that are included with your admission.  Unfortunately they recently expanded the 'paid' area for these concerts making it more difficult to get a good seat.  You often have to get there hours before the concert and bake in the sun before it starts.  They also have these annoying light towers that block a large portion of the free seats from good views on both sides of the stage. Why can't these be moved out since they are no longer used for the summer Cirque Due Soleil shows that are no longer offered.\n\nThe park has several other fun things to do like the animal areas, ice skating shows, singing and dancing shows and a Sesame Street kids area that even has a little-kids roller coaster (Air Grover) that is actually pretty fun even for adults.  Also a new roller coaster is opening in a couple months...\n\nOverall a great park that would get us back as customers if they brought back the two-year membership AND cared why we didn't renew in the first place.",

There were a few rides that were relaxing for myself like the water Rapids, a train that takes you from one end of the park to the next while encountering animals, the sky ride, cobra curse and Sand Serpent. They had a indoor ice skating performance. And many animals like Lion, monkey, penguin, elephant, cheetahs, alligators and much more. What I didn't like about the park is your not allowed to bring food or drinks.",

      "text": "Going to Busch Gardens really wasn't a priority for this trip.  The only other time I've been to Tampa was on a day trip to go to Busch Gardens back in 2000 so I didn't feel the urge to return. My ever-so-charming host and Tampa native lives literally next door to Busch Gardens.  After breakfast at Waffle House, it was 9:30am on Sunday morning and I didn't want to kill time until noon when stores opened up in Hyde Park.  Since Busch Gardens was open, we figured we should spend at least part of our day there.  It was great that we could just walk 4 blocks to the park entrance.\n\nTickets are $65 but they're like a season pass.  I get free entry no matter how many times I return between now and the rest of the year.  It's a nice added-value in case I do return to Tampa this year.\n\nI love rollercoasters and Busch Gardens has some of the best.  The SheiKra features a 90 degree, 200 foot drop.  The car stops right on the curve for 10 seconds so you're looking straight down and then you plummet.  This is one of the best rollercoasters ever.\n\nI loved riding the Montu back in 2000 and got to go twice this time.  You get to go really fast in inverted loops and your feet get to dangle.  The Gwazi is an intertwined, double wooden rollercoaster - shaky as hell but that's part of the fun.  The Kumba has a few long drops and a huge 360 degree spiral.  The adrenaline was pumping after going on all these rides.\n\nMy favorite water ride here is the Congo River Rapids.  You're on a 12 person circular raft and you're hit by water cannons, huge rapids and go under a waterfall.  It's bumpy and you'll get drenched.\n\nI really only wanted to go on the thrill rides but I was convinced to go on the Rhino Rally.  It's set up as a safari ride in a land rover and we drive around looking at the different animals.  In the middle there are some theatrics where we've steered of course and then we're floating in a river.  It's cute and a good option for families.\n\nThe park was busy but there didn't seem to be much of a wait for many of the rides.  Maybe 15-20 minutes at most.  It also helps when you can navigate the park with ease when your host knows Busch Gardens like the back of his hand.\n\nI couldn't leave the park without having me some Dippin' Dots.  I do love those Dippin' Dots.",

I like Busch garden I'm their gold pass member,every time I go I see a company trying very hard to improve and compete with other theme park,they almost put out a new ride every year how much more can people asking for?

But no worries; this park is still top notch. \n\nI appreciated all of the animal encounters that you can do without having to pay extra. One of the staff with the elephants was super generous; since he saw us there earlier in the day, when we came back later in the evening, he let us feed one of them, and gave us more demonstrations. He showed us what to do to get her to shake her head and a couple of other movements!  It was all of our highs for the day!!!  I highly encourage asking tons of questions about these beautiful creatures. The staff loves their animals and appreciates your curiosity.  I also appreciated their use of \"we ask the animals to do...\" They no longer demand the animals to perform any tasks; they use only positive encouragement/reinforcement. \n\nYou also have to stop by and see the kangaroos.

      "text": "I have always loved Busch Gardens, and have been coming here for 40 something years. I enjoy both locations (Tampa and Williamsburg) immensely. You may find a bad review here or there, but I would chalk that up to a patron having an issue versus something that would occur often. Take those with a grain of salt.  Of course, this being a theme park, the food prices are outrageous, but the quality is very high, and I am not aware of any exceptions to this pricing scheme anywhere in the country at any park. There is nothing there food-wise that disappoints. As a matter of fact there was nothing disappointing in the entire visit.  The only thing I can complain about is a minor thing which is a pet peeve of mine. The website does not have the correct amount showing for parking.  Theme park that has an annual budget of hundreds of millions of dollars (not an exaggeration) art to be able to have correct parking fee information on the website. I don't think I'm being nitpicky about that. Parking was $25 and the website clearly stated $18 when I checked in the morning before we left the house. It's not a big of a deal in practice, but a huge operation like that should be able to have an accurate price on the website. I highly recommend the meal plan option which adds about the cost of 1.5 meals to your ticket but it entitles you to (as of this writing) One entr\u00e9e, one side,  one dessert, and one beverage every hour from open till close. There may a few people that would be able to actually achieve that, But you could theoretically eat $600 worth of food in a day there on your meal plan. I think we paid about $30 for it. Unless you are absolutely not going to eat anything, you pretty much cannot go wrong buying the meal plan.  If you buy your tickets at least three days in advance online you should be able to save enough money so that the ticket plus the meal plan ends up being the same price as if you walked up and paid entrance fee at the gate. Realistically this means if you buy your tickets in advance you pretty much are eating for free all day. The meal plan works at any of the restaurant type places but it does not work at the small little's ice cream stands etc.  Unless somethings very much out of the ordinary happens I can guarantee you that if you go there you will not be disappointed. One last thing before I close: if you were there many years ago you will remember the brewery tour. They Close the doors to that brewing facility in 1995 as it was their smallest facility. When it opened in 1959 the brewery served five states but by 1967, even though production at the plant had doubled, that facility was serving only Florida. When it closed it was the smallest brewing facility owned by Anheuser-Busch.  Maybe I am \"geezing\" if I say this but in my opinion it would've been nice to leave it open and connected to the park as it could've certainly remained at least somewhat profitable and would've been an interesting insight into brewing. Even if it's not a super efficient plant it would have been something nice for people to be able to see",

The best deal to taste wine or beer and food is to get a pass. I spent $48 for 5 food tastes and 5 drinks. My friend did the same and we shared all the food and were able to try a lot more dishes this way.  We were actually full after 5 plates so saved the rest for after the Kenny Rogers concert. My absolute favorite was the Grilled pound cake sandwich that had a cheesecake filling and raspberry dipping sauce on the side. The recipe is on their website and I plan to save it and recreate it! The smoke beef brisket was quite good and so was the coconut shrimp. As for the drinks.. I had korbel champagne, a rose champagne, chardonney, Pino Noir and a frozen drink called a Dreamsicle. It had vodka in it and was refreshing as it was warm out. It tasted just like the ice cream bar.. With a kick of course. :) There is also a ton of beer to try for you beer lovers. Watch out Disney! This food Fest was just as good in my mind and less expensive AND.. For me.. Close to home. I hope they also do the Brew Fest this fall. I'll be there if they do!",

I think the best part was the kangaroo area, where you can feed and pet the 'roos!  So much fun!  Also make sure you go to the tiger enclosure - there is a tiger there that will ham it up for the camera all day long!  We got some great photos because of that.\n\nThe roller coasters here are awesome!  Shiekra is probably the one I found the scariest - the drop is literally 90 degrees straight down.  Extremely intense!  I also liked the Kumba coaster a lot.  The new Cheetah Hunt is pretty neat, though not as fast as I was expecting.  It does, however, cover a lot of land, which is cool!\n\nIf roller coasters are your thing, make sure that you get Quick Passes - and get them early in the day, as the price goes up as the day continues.  They are WELL worth the money and you are easily able to skip the majority of the long lines.  We never regretted buying them for a second.\n\nThe skyride is fun - be sure to check that out!  The train is also neat.  Both rides give you some really cool views of the park.\n\nI would definitely recommend a visit to Busch Gardens!",

At the map the information were wrong, the food areas they have according to the map the dinning program tell us NO! \nWe are not big eaters, but to pay $ 35 a person for cold Asian food, a drink and then after 3 hours we tried again something, that was okay. \nThe Serengeti Safari was nice, you saw a couple of animals, not a lot, it cost per person $39, not cheap at all, but it helps those in the program to breed animals.\nUnfortunately, many of the enclosures are not really close to an European standard, they are much too small and often not really species-appropriate.\nA lot of money for NOTHING!\nAnd we had to drive 1.5 hours each way!\nWe will not go back to this park.",

      "text": "Great theme park in the Tampa area. Busch Gardens is like a zoo and a theme park since they have both animals and rides. One of my kids' favorite ride is the train ride. The train takes you around the park and the best part is being able to see the animals up close. The park is huge and lots of things to do/see. I love their \"Waves of honor\" program which they offer free and discounted tickets for military and their family once per year. If you're in active duty definitely take advantage of that. I'd definitely be visiting Busch Gardens again even without the military discounts. Check the park out and you will be glad you did.",

My three yr old LOVED every minute there.  If your traveling with little ones, make sure you bring their bathing suits with, there's a little water park in there too... we didn't know that so our little ones didn't get to partake... \n\nAnyway, this is a great park to visit and we do plan on going back!  The most disappointing part was that one of the ride we could actually take both of our kids on, Rhino Rally, was in part broken down... the water wasn't working on it so we didn't get the full effect.  But the kids loved seeing all the animals on the rides!\n\nWe will totally go again when the kids are older and can enjoy much more of it!",

Lifts up to 300 feet and drops at a 90 angle at 60mph. I think I'll pass on this one as well and head to the toddler Sesame Street play area while enjoying a fresh made waffle cone filled with mint chocolate chip ice cream. Even though I'm not a thrill seeker you can see there is still always something for everyone to enjoy here.  FL residents can pay a flex pass and it breaks down to $10 a month per person for a year.

Plus, they are somewhat cheaper than Disney in regards to tickets and even food. I spent about $11 on a heavy/big sandwich, with chips and a drink. \nIt was super packed today though, so after waiting for more than 45 mins in line for 2 rides, we ended up getting the quick queue and it was life changing. (We actually asked if they offered single rider, but they do not) Our wait time went from 45 mins to about 5 mins, real quick, and we were able to actually enjoy the rides and go flying past everyone else. We even had time to fit in a last minute ride, before having to get to our bus (we had like 25 mins left). The quick queues can be a bit pricey, we paid $42 (day of), but we thought it was worth it since we were able to ride all the rides and probably wouldn't have been able to without it. I would definitely recommend buying them in advance if you can cause they are like half price. \nAlso, just a side note, beware that the people that attend this theme park are not always the classiest.",

      "text": "Busch gardens!! Personally, I love animals and natural-looking/natural surroundings over fake man-made colorful buildings. This place is so beautiful! The rides here are far better than the rides at Disney. Disney is AWESOME of course. Each park is great in its own way. This park is more geared towards wildlife, animals, and ROLLER COASTERS. There are different themes in this park such as Morocco, Egypt/desert, jungle, African, etc. \n\nNow, ROLLER COASTERS!! If you are a thrill-seeker like me, here is a list of rides you need to go on: Sheikra (must go at least twice lol), Kumba, Gwazi (awesome wooden coaster), and Montu. Those are my faves in that order. Yes there are more rides to choose from, but those were my faves. Scorpian was alright...I went on that last and after the rides prior, it was nothing.\n\nAnother ride I would recommend is more laid back compared to those coasters...Congo River Rapids. Expect to get a little wet or maybe a lot..depends on where you sit and how lucky you are haha.\n\nThere was an area in the \"Edge of Africa\" section of the park where you could go to the large glass window, and tigers would come right up to you as if they wanted to take a picture with you lol. There are several areas in the park where there are animals around you as if you were at a zoo. You can go on safari rides (one for an additional cost). \n\nThere was a show we watched --I think it was at the Marrakesh Theater--not sure...but it was spectacular! So many different costumes and settings, colors were amazing, music was great, dancing and singing performances were beautiful. I think they change their shows every so often, but the show we watched was about old folk tales. We also watched a 4D movie at the Timbuktu Theater. It was cute. 4D=3D movie with glasses and getting lightly sprayed/misted with water.\n\nWe ate at the Desert Grill. There were live singing and dancing performances here. It's basically a huge place with a stage for shows and picnic tables for the audience to eat and watch. There is a section for choosing/ordering/buying your food...kind of like a cafeteria.\n\nIf you are sick of Disney and want to shake things up a bit, this is a great place to go to! I really enjoyed this place and I've been to all the Disney parks..this place is refreshing! =)\n\nOh and here's a tip...this place has sister parks: SeaWorld, Aquatica, Discovery Cove, and Adventure Island. Go find discounts if you plan on going to more than one of these parks!! =)",

      "text": "Fun times to be had, just plan more than one day.  We got there shortly after three parked opened at 0930.  Parking was fine in the standard area, no need to upgrade, especially with the team that takes you right to the gate.  I figure if you are heading to busch gardens where you will be walking all day, you most likely don't have any issues that would require the extra $5 to park preferred, and if you do you will likely get handicapped parking in the same area, without paying extra.\nAs for the park, there are plenty of awesome rides.  Unfortunately my son was an inch too short for the larger coasters, and me daughter was literally 1/4 too short for dinner of them. Needless to say they are strict on the height rules, 1/4\" precluded her on numerous rides.  \nAs it does commonly in Florida, bad weather did roll in, and they did shut down the rides a few times.  This is an inconvenience, however I would suggest staying in the line when everyone else bails.  Typically the storms cone in and are gone within 10-20 minutes.  If you stay you will likely be at the front of the line or pretty close when the ride opens back up.  You can wait out the rain for 20 minutes and get right on, or leave the line with everyone else and come back when the wait will be more like 45 minutes.\nWe stayed at the park till it closed at 9:00pm.  We ended up only getting to ride like 5-6 rides. Beware the train takes 45+ minutes to do a round trip, so either use it for transport around the park or realize it will take a chunk of your day to get all the way around.\nWe paid for the dining plan, and let me tell you, worth every penny!  Not only do you get to eat whatever you want for the most part, but you get buy 1 get one free on all snack cart items.  When a churro is $5 and you want 4, $10 is way better than $20. Also the deal extended to souvenir cups and we received an additional discount.  So one trrip to a cart and I got two souvenir cups, two churros and two dippin dots for $18.  Considering the regular price of one souvenir cup works have been $11.99 plus tax you can see how good of a deal it was.  You also get free refills on the souvenir mugs anywhere all, or a 20oz bottle of dasani.  \nWe ate at the smokehouse restaurant and it was delicious. Best brisket outside of texas I have had.\nThe rides we ride were fun and other than cheetah hunt, the lines were short!\n\nDefinitely would recommend.  Military can use the wave of honor program and get free admission for themselves and there direct dependents.  But a bad way to spend a day with your family.",

      "text": "I was excited to go to Busch Gardens because I'd gotten tired of riding kiddie rides at Disney World. It's time for some roller coaster actions!! Yeah!!! I didn't mind having to drive about an hour from my hotel in Orlando into Tampa Bay.  I went on a Monday so the park would be open by 9:00 AM and close by 7:00 PM. My plan of attack was to get there as early as possible so I wouldn't have to stand so long in lines because roller coaster lines are ALWAYS long, mmkay?  \n\nI had purchased my tickets online because it's actually cheaper by $10 per ticket. Also, you get a 2nd day entry ticket for free. However, I didn't opt for the 2nd day ticket. Instead, I decided to pay an additional $10 per ticket to get the \"All Day dining\" deal.  I checked inside the park and the all day dining coupon would cost you $32.95 + tax per person. So this was pretty awesome. You. Yes, you. Take note. Check online first before buying tickets at the gate.\n\nAnyway... me being me, and my sister being her... we left our hotel kind of late. So we didn't get to the park until around 9:30 AM. No problem, right?? We paid $14.00 to park, and then we took the tram to the gate. We redeemed our tickets and on we went into the park!! FUN TIME!  I (tried to) ran to the first ride, Cheetah hunt. But my sister kind of slowed me down because... well, she's slow... so by the time we got there at around 10:00 Am, the wait time was approximately 70 minutes. No worries... I knew I was going to be waiting in lines. However... after around 20 minutes waiting in line, I heard that dreaded announcement over the loud speaker, \"Cheetah Hunt is experiencing technical difficulties and will be temporarily closed. We don't know how long it will take until the problem is resolved. Yada, yada, yada, blah, blah, blah\"\n\nDissapointed, we decided to ride something else... so we went to the closest coaster from there, Scorpion. We waited in lines for 10 minutes... and then we heard  the announcement, \"due to incoming weather, Scorpion is temporarily shut down\" At this point I was like, \"WTF?!?!?! Seriously?!?!?!\" while looking up to see perfectly clear skies with the sun shining down on me, giving me a butt-ugly tan line on my arms and on my face in the shape of my sunglasses!!\n\nAnyway, this weather crap goes on for around, hmmm let's see, FOUR HOURS!!!!!!! Yes, I had to wait for four hours before I actually got to ride anything!!! Yes, it finally drizzled a little bit, but there was no storm, no high wind, no nothing.  Okay, just to be fair, there were some lightnings, but I didn't think I was going to get zapped on the ride.\n\nWe didn't get to ride our first ride, Scorpion, until around 2:00 PM. And at this point, I knew that if I wanted to ride all the roller coasters, I'd have to get the quick queue pass. Another $35 for each rider.  However, after this point, everything was great. No more waiting in lines. Each ride took us maybe 10 - 20 minutes max. However the park was pretty big, and the sun was scorching. We stayed until closing time. Of course, I wanted to make sure that we took advantage of the dining deal so we had carrot cakes, lots of bottled water, chicken strips, grilled chicken sandwich, etc.  The dining deal also gives you 50% off the food vendors all over the park. But I only wanted free food so no, I didn't get a churro even though I wanted one. A half price churro would still cost you $2!! It's only $1 at Costco, mmkay?\n\nAnyway, except for the rides being shut down and the fact that I had to wait four hours before my first ride. Tampa is pretty fun for roller coaster rides. It's no Cedar Point, but it's goof for now.\n\nP.S. The wet rides WILL get you SOAKED!!!! I'd save these rides for last.",

Bring your excited children, pack your patient pants, and don't forget your wallet. \n\nI've been to Busch Gardens twice now, October 2015 and October 2016, both times our family (overall had a great time). Because the park is oh-so big, allow me to lay out the yays and nays.\n\nYays:\n-If your kids remotely like Sesame Street, that portion of the park will delight them. Beyond the show itself, there a ton of rides and activities for kids 2+. My 4 year old was jazzed to go on the bigger girl rides this past year. Don't miss the Cookie Monster jump pad...but know that getting your kids out of there can take a Herculean effort, despite the staff being on point!\n\n-BBQ Grill: Possibly the best food option in the park. If I were rating just that restaurant, it was earn 3 stars. Brisket is pretty solid! \n\n-The train is really fun and it's amazing to see the animals up close! The staff are really sweet too.\n\n-Every restroom I popped into was very clean and well-stocked.  \n\n-It's such a giant space that you can certainly find something for kids and adults of all ages.\n\n-Beer garden. They have beer.\n\n-The bird exhibit (that you can walk through) is immersive and cool.\n\nNays: \n-The best food you're likely to eat is so-so and, to no shock to anyone, really expensive. \n\n-While it's really nice to get some family pics taken, you'll pay an arm and a leg for the digital copies alone. \n\n-Kids meals don't have a ton of healthy options for sides. I'm not advocating for kale chips, but maybe some whole fruit instead of fries? \n\n-It's hit or miss with the animals, but this isn't really the park's fault. Some we were able to see closely and catch some interesting tidbits and others the enclosures we set up oddly and we couldn't see very much. \n\n**********\n\nPro tip: Pay for the VIP parking. You get so much closer to the park!",

Thousands of people go everyday; what else can you expect? Luckily, we went on a day that was relatively slow, so we were able to get on all the rides without a problem. We only ate once at Zagora Caf\u00e9, and the food was pretty good! Pricey, but then again, in what theme park isn't the food pricey? \nThe rides were super cool and were sure to fill you with adrenaline and excitement. I especially loved Montu and the Cheetah Hunt. Rode on them twice! \nWill always come back to Busch Gardens!",

Coming down from Chicago I was excited to come to Busch gardens because I love roller coasters. It was my last day in Florida before I headed back home and decided to spent it here. After one ride it started raining horrible and everything in the parked closed. I went to customer service where I was told that this is basically what happens \"when I decide to vacation at Florida where it rains every day!!! \" thanks Catelyn! Maybe next time I decide to spend 319$ on an amusement park ticket I'll go to Orlando!!! While there's limits to what certain people can do, I was never told to wait while someone else who maybe could help me better came.",

Sure they have a few rides (nothing spectacular that will knock your socks of) but the line wait to get on the rides are ridiculous.  They have some animal exibits but youre better off going to a zoo and its cheaper.  The bierfest beer garden was smaller than expected and really didnt have a huge selection.  We had a mixup at the front gate as well.  Richard accidentally linked my card to another account and used it to pay for a bill that was owed.  My friend who has a season pass should have been able to get me a comp ticket but richard didnt seem to understand that so he charged me full price even though I showed him my retired id card.  So I paid for a full ticket and 20.00 that someone else owed to busch gardens.  I visit tampa once or twice a year.  I wont be coming back. You can find better more fun and cheaper ways to entertain yourself while in tampa than coming here.",

First the employees don't care.  Watched numerous ones walk by trash and not pick it up, their knowledge of the park is not extensive, and ride operators don't care.  Three different rides a family who greatly abused your RAP program held up lines for atleast 2 cycles while family members rode it twice and hopped along to front and back seats.  One employee saw it and attempted to stop them and say they could only ride it once and not abusing the program until another told her it's not her job or her waiting, who cares.  Saw a man on the Congo rapids who was heavy set and struggling to get his belt on. Employee stood by and watched instead of getting the belt extension out which I know they have.  He looked very upset and uncomfortable by the time he got it buckled.  On the same ride the employee in the front let a man in an electric chair rented from the park into the general admission line and always ran over my kid! Training goes a long way. Yours seems to be lacking greatly.\n\nQuick queue has ruined your park and all others.  Unless you spend the additional money for quick queue you'll be lucky to get in 4 rides during the day.  We were able to get on Montu, cheetah, cobras curse and the Congo river rapids.  Wait times were all in excess of an hour. Between that and walking that's all we could fit in.  If anything limit quick queue, I saw more stands selling those then drinks.\n\nWent to the theatre to eat and the food quality is worse every year.  Lunch hour saw minimum cashiers working.  One show during the lunch hour kind stinks cause we missed it bc of the long lines elsewhere.\n\nOh and $25 for parking. Yeah I'll just leave that alone.\n\nMight be time for leadership to look hard at how they operate.  Heck go be on undercover boss as a regular no extras general admission guest, to ride operator , to food employee.  I'd love to see the reaction to that episode!",

It's a bit of a walk for my parents but manageable . We definitely used it after walking the park all day. \n\nPark is clean , was not crowded at all and was easy to get around.  When we first got there we did the sky ride, which gives you an overhead view of most of the park and the animal safari.  We were glad we did that first as it got shut down after due to wind. \n\nLots of great roller coasters, I only did one of the smaller ones with my son. But if roller coasters are your thing you won't be disappointed. But the main attraction are the animals. The safari was cool, the apes and elephants were cool. The bird experience was awesome. You enter a netted area that the fly all around . You can also feed them. They landed on my dads head and shoulder looking for food . Kids thought that was great. \n\nLunch was great , we choose a big hall type cafeteria style with 5 or 6 different types of food. Great choices. \n\nSo glad we made a day trip there",

The water fountains are so well hidden, we had to ask staff where the closest water fountain was.  Not just once, but three times through the course of the day.  That's a life safety risk.  #2 Negative.  We had a small backpack.  Most rides we went on had a cubby we could place it in while enjoying the ride.  But we were denied entrance to one ride with the backpack. (No cubby's on this one.) We were told we would have to rent a nearby locker (minimum $8 to rent). So FU to the fun-hating accountant at Busch Gardens that caused our family to split up on that ride so one of us could hold the bag.",

The parking is always very organized and staff seem courteous and helpful. There are much better rides at other amusement parks where I am from such as Cedar Point, King's Island, etc., but Sheikra and Cheetah Hunt will keep thrill seekers coming back for more. I think that the \"zoo theme\" is the best attraction. Even better than the Lowry Park Zoo down the street, Busch Gardens showcases a multitude of exotic animals in a family friendly setup. My favorite has always been the tigers due to the super close proximity to the animals. \n\nThe only real negative that I can think of is the crowd at times. Definitely avoid Friday-Sunday at all times and try to stick to during the week. Sometimes, you will see busloads of nonnative speakers who are extremely rude and break a lot of the posted rules there. Just make sure to watch your belongings and hold little ones close so they do not get trampled. My family once had a few of these kids steal our food while we were not looking and then deny what they did to their chaperone. I simply reported them to security and had them tossed out of the park. You can avoid these situations just by going earlier in the week during the day. Overall, Busch Gardens is highly recommended and a must do down here in Florida.",

Certainly not worth the 2 hour drive from Orlando.\n\nOne good thing about Busch Gardens is that if you have a mix of rollercoaster enthusiasts and chickens in your group, everyone will have something to do.  The downside is that everyone will only have something to do for a few hours.  There are only a handful of rollercoasters, all of which are pretty tame compared to 6 Flags Great America and are REALLY short.  Then, once you've taken the Serengeti Express to see the animals, you've pretty much done it all.  There's an aviary and a cave and a few other exhibits tucked around the park, but definitely not enough to fill up the entire day.  \nThis park is HUGE, but most of it is filled up with carnival games and souvenir booths.  So you have to walk forever through the sweltering heat to get to anything of any consequence.  There's a 4-D theater, but it's cheesy and the sound didn't work half the time.\nWhatever you do, DO NOT go in May.  This place was SWARMING with school groups... you know, 30 kids supervised by 2 adults, hopped up on sugar and excitement, running around with giant carnival prizes, cutting you off, screaming, jumping around, running into you...  \n\nThis place is probably a blast if you have little ones and want to play with them in Busch Garden's giant (and really cool looking) kiddie play areas.  But if you want to ride rollercoasters, just go to 6 Flags... there will be more and better rides, and you won't get bored so quickly.  If you want to see animals, go to a zoo... you'll see more animals and you won't have to walk around such a sprawling park to see them and you'll be far more comfortable. \n\nBottom line:  Do it once, if you must (just not in May).  But otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.  There are better theme parks out there.",

      "text": "We were there 9/28.  It was overcast, but it was also empty.  Lines were small (except Cheetah Hunt) and we could go on rides over and over.  My personal favorite ride was Kumba.  It's long, fast, and had plenty of strong g-forces.  It was enough to almost make my wife pass out.  Sheikra was also very fun.  Falcon's Fury was amazing.  When it turns you on your stomach, that feeling of not having a seat and all of your weight is on that harness, it's just awesome.  The drop is a little short though.  But since it was empty, I could ride over and over with no wait.  Scorpion was a little rough, so I wasn't a big fan.  Cheetah Hunt was cool too.  The inversion ride (I forget the name) was fun.\n\nMy only complaint?  The people working there sure didn't seem like they cared to work there.  Just bored faces.  They weren't rude or anything, just an observation.  The area leading up to Busch Gardens was kinda run down, but whatever.  Also, if you can, pay the extra few bucks and get the closest parking spots.  I recommend this place.",

      "text": "There are a lot of great amusement parks out there, but for so many reasons, this is my #1 all time super greatest most favorite one of all.  Why is it so great?  In no particular order: (1) the rides (2) the atmosphere (3) the animals (4) the food (5) you can go all year long!\n\n(1) The rides:\nMontu (one of my top 10 steel coasters - when there's no line, it's like heaven for me)\nSheikra (awesome thrills and theming - even better than its big brother, Griffon at BGE)\nGwazi (lion and tiger and rumble rumble rumble rumble until you've gone silly)\nKumba (one of lots of people's favorites - great layout and so smooth)\nPython (RIP)\nCheetah Chase!! (I love wild mouse rides!!!!!!!)\nWater rides - Congo River Rapids, Stanley Falls, Tidal Wave (that cold water feels so good during the summer)\nScorpion (a little rough but fun)\nRhino Rally (the drivers are sort of cheesy, but I love this ride through the animal habitat)\n\n(2) The atmosphere: this park (along with its sister park in Williamsburg) is so well-kept.  The trees and plants are gorgeous, the walkways are clean, the bathrooms are as clean as you can expect when thousands of people are using them, the animals and coasters are well cared for, the staff is generally friendly, there are lots of shows, etc. - happy happy happy\n\n(3) The animals: these little (and big) guys are probably why this is my favorite park - combining two of my favorite things (roller coasters and animals) was GENIUS.  The habitats are really nice - you don't feel sorry for any of the animals at this park - and there are lots of learning opportunities for the little (and big) ones in your group.\n\n(4) The food: man I don't know what it is about the Desert Grill, but that turkey sandwich with potato salad drives me crazy!  It's the greatest thing to keep you going during a long day at the park.  The food isn't cheap, but you get A LOT.  Other food in the park is also really solid, but I usually hit that smorgasboard (and avoid the Crown Colony) for lunch.\n\n(5) You can go all year long!: I was born and raised in Florida, so I love some warm winter weather - especially if it means more time to ride coasters!  Almost every time we're visiting family in Florida, we make the short trip to Tampa - it's always worth it!",

Shop at beginning of park is amazing as sells a lot of homemade arty things, jewellery and other unique stuff. I brought a lovely metal art picture that was made from a man in Haiti some of the proceeds go towards helping people in Haiti as well. All animals seem happy and they have great space to roam in. \nTips: feed kangeroos in morning whilst hungry and active, feed birds early whilst hungry, visit animals in morning whilst active, don't miss the hippo amazing seeing it in the clean clear water, there are so many squirrels about that are tame so you can feed them by hand, book the Serengeti tour (get to meet touch and meert giraffes)",

Though I live in Chicago, I've taken my 2 year old to BG 3 times in 2010 alone! There is a lot of construction going on, but there is still lots to do. I'm not giving it 5 stars because there were one too many downed rides EVERY time we were there. Other than that, it's a nice place to visit...go to the shows and return the next day if you can because it adds to the experience by helping you to feel that the park fee you paid is worth it.

      "text": "When I hear Bush Gardens, I immediately think roller coasters.  I had absolutely no idea they had a zoo of sorts. We only came for a few hours on our weekend trip to the Orlando Tampa area. My sister scored some free tickets and I thought this would be the perfect time to see what this place is all about.\n\nNow, I do not like roller coasters not even the kiddie ones, so I do not enjoy riding them. They have many of them, some even go underground and you get to see screaming people pass quite close. Fun to watch, but alas  I did not try any, so I cannot include any of that on my review. I can include however is that the animals  we saw,  look very well-maintained and taken care of. Their habitats are spacious too.  but they don't have as many animals as an actual zoo,  And they are quite far apart so you need to do a lot of walking without seeing anything before you get to see another animal. You can ride the train that goes around the park and you get to see some of the more tame animals in their habitats from station to station. Although they did have the rhino who could have  just charged at the train at any moment. That was a little bit scary because he happen to be very close when the train rode past his section. All in all it is a great place if you enjoy nature and the thrill of roller coasters. I myself wouldn't necessarily be back. I would just go to the zoo to enjoy animals, but it is a pretty neat place.",

Living in Orlando it isn't that far to travel every few weekends or so...plus the deal I got was great. $15 a month for Sea World and Busch Gardens which included free parking and disocunts off merchandise and food. This I believe was the 1-year passport paid by EZ Pay. \n\nWhen I went I bought the all day dining deal for $30 per person and $15 for kids. My fiance and I definitely got our moneys worth from this. We had lunch, a snack, and later on a dinner....just a lunch and drink for two people is already $22 or so. Not to mention in other places like the ice cream shop, Dip N Dots, and other stands you'll receive 50% off the bill! Thats a bargain. \n\nMy new favorite roller coaster here at Busch G is the Cheetah! I have been waiting a whie to go on this and I had such a good time. The wait was about 30-40 minutes but definitely worth it. I believe the fill up 3 coasters at a time so the line movies quite fast. The best part was the first hill you go up when it just shoots you up. \n\nThe other best coaster I have always loved is Gwazi, even though I think over the past couple of years its gotten a lot more intense and rough. It really slings you around and has you all over the place. There wasn't any line for the longest time so we kept going on about 3 times. \n\nSheikra is also amazing. The thrill just to stop just as your about to go down you see everything beneath and see yourself drop seconds later. Short coaster but still FUN! Loading time is fast as well because of the 8 people per row. \n\nNext is the animal exibits which I LOVE!! I believe they added a new part which features kangaroo's. This was one of my favourites because I was able to reach in and touch them..surprisingly they are very soft. The elephants are absolutely beautiful along with the lions and tigers, its amazing to see these animals with only a glass wall separating you.",

I can watch hours of Netflix's \"Planet Earth\" without fatigue and if youtube is on the menu, I'll watch roller coaster videos in 4K all night. Thus, Tampa called my name and I wasn't disappointed. The whole park is eloquently themed with beautiful gardens and flawless design that makes every square inch a convincing part of a wild experience. Usually the time between rides is the worst part of an amusement park but my wife and I found that we couldn't take our eyes off the beautiful orangutans or fearsome tigers that were literally inches from our faces. If that wasn't enough, amazing coasters like Sheikra, Cheetah Hunt, Kumba, and Montu provided such intense and unique experiences that we couldn't ride them just once. I love to walk away from something, not being able to decide what the best part was and that was my experience at Busch Gardens. Word of advice, secure your phone on Montu or it WILL fall out.

      "text": "Busch Gardens is home to award-winning coasters, exotic wildlife, and excitement for all ages. This beautifully maintained, African-themed park hosts several events per year and has rehabilitated thousands of animals. If your adrenaline starts flowing at the thought of exhilarating rides, look no further than Cheetah Hunt, SheiKra, Kumba, Falcons Fury, Cobras Curse, and Montu! \n\nPerhaps you're not an adrenaline junkie but you enjoy site seeing. The Sky Ride launches from the same entrance as Cheetah Hunt, and drifts across the entire park at a few miles per hour. Convenient travel option for avoiding walking through crowds on your way to Stanleyville. Fantastic viewing of the vast safari scape with hundreds of animals roaming.  \n\nBusch Gardens is also a zoo that exhibits hundreds of animal species, many of which you can feed. Tiger Lookout is a little scary. One person at a time climbs up into the tigers den to watch them from an enclosed case. The safari tour visits giraffes you can feed lettuce and take photos with. You'll be lucky to score Will as your tour guide! Walkabout Way features adorably friendly wallabies and kangaroos. The animal care center gives you an inside look at the veterinary services provided. You may even witness treatments in session. \n\nFamilies with small children venture to Sesame Street Safari for the water play area, swing ride and Grover's rollercoaster. The park has traditional carnival games and an arcade. Not to mention fireworks, ice shows and dance performances. \n\nDuring the holidays Busch Gardens transforms into Howl-O-Scream (for those into Halloween) followed by Christmas Town and New Years Eve. The ambient Christmas lights illuminate the park at night. I recently attended a work party in one the function rooms. What a nice surprise! Open bar, freshly carved turkey with mashed potatoes, stuffing and veggies. Hands down the best meal at Busch Gardens. The park food in general is greasy stadium-grade junk. Ultimately this park lacks quality concessions outside of Food and Wine Festivals. \n\nParking can take up to a 30 min. The yearly pass with VIP parking is worth it for frequent visitors. There is a tram available in most sections or walking takes 10-20 minutes. \n\nBesides Sesame Street there are no commercial attractions. The crowd feels less chaotic than at Disney and Universal. Tickets under $100 are still obtainable. Busch Gardens may lack modern conveniences such as air conditioned stations and fancy wrist bands but its authenticity outshines the competition.",

You can rent a locker for $1 or $10 all day choose your own 4 digit code, takes cash or credit. Universal has better costumes, but we got a $30 deal in August totally worth it.",

Some are better than others -- AKA don't put me on the rickety wooden coasters (those really hurt, actually) but instead put me on Cheetah Hunt! Woo hoo. Montu is also great.\n\nSheikra has to be the most terrifying ride I've ever been on in my entire life, and I consider myself a bit of a thrillseeker in theme park land. Those few seconds seem to last forever when you're at the very top of the coaster, looking down at Tampa. \n\nThe park also boasts a lot of animals, which is really cool. You can hop on the tram and jet across the park and see all the elephants and other animals just hanging out. \n\nPrices are good, the entertainment is great. Busch Gardens also has really fun events like Howl-O-Scream and Christmas Town, which lights up the whole park and is one of the coolest events I've been to at a theme park.",

This time the bar is all out of everything.   It's 11:30 am and the lines for rides are 55 min wait lol...    yeah...   just spent an additional $300 so my family can \"enjoy\" the day.   Smh...   this park.... why do I keep coming backv\n\n\n11/11 - Here again.   After last incident BG gave us skip the line passes.   Only good for one line jump per ride (not quick que unlimited).   We used them yesterday and it was an ok day.   Today the kids were in line for Cobras Curse.   Estimated wait showing?  65 mins.   Actually time? 2 hours 5mins!!!   Yes my children spend half a day waiting to ride a ride !!!!    Why?  Lightening?   ZERO.   It was Busch Gardens favorite recording \"Due to technical difficulties\".   \n\nYesterday they removed the Platinum parking without notice.   That was a total nightmare trying to navigate two handicapped folks about a mile to get into the park.   I sent a message to guest relations...   (nobody cares.).   We will purchase quick que unlimited for the kids tomorrow ($150.00 extra) because without it the Park is a complete waste of time.   Unless you want to spend all day waiting in line.   \n\n\n\n\n\nCompletely awful!!!!   I can understand weather but holy sh!t...    every single ride \"Down for technical difficulties...\".  Omg....   we've been here two days and our children have got on 3 rides.    Between weather and \"technical difficulties.\"   We paid $1500 PLUS HOTEL for me, my husband, and 3 children.    This park has gone down hill BIGTIME!   \n\nAlso our kids went to get on the SHEIKRA and they were in the seat and the ride shut down.   The tech workers are there working within a few minutes but it too ma few hours.   They tried to go back and they were told NO too small.  I've posted photos.   It's close but NO....   \n\nI am headed to customer service to voice my complaints and I bet they don't do crap!",

      "text": "I'm a Gold Pass member and I'm a tad disappointed. First off, as a Florida resident, I'm well aware of \"weather\" conditions (trust me). However, I was disappointed this last time because after buying a Quick Queue ticket ($80.00) the park decided to shut their rides down due to possible lightening in the area. Now been there done that, usually I'm understanding. This time my friends and I had only managed to go on 1 ride before this happened. We then waited a full 2 hours hoping the rides would reopen (it was sunny, but we get that safety comes first). We decided to leave and attempted to go back later or at another date, which the park was fine with. They gave my friends who paid for their tickets new tickets for another time. However, they refused to refund or replace our Quick Queue tickets, which were the most expensive items. We each paid ($80.00) for them. Again, would have been fine with giving us a \"next time\" ticket rather than a refund, but they refused. I find this wrong honestly. Considering the money people spend here, they should be more understanding to this issue. Again, I get weather happens and is out of their control, but guests won't come back after spending almost $400 on tickets they couldn't even use while at the park, especially your annual pass holders who are paying monthly for your benefits etc. It's definitely disappointing.",

As a Florida resident living in the ultimate theme park state, I would have to say Busch Gardens is one of my top favorites of all the theme parks, if not my number one favorite.  I like it, because in my opinion, it's just the right size- it's not too huge that it can't be conquered in one day, but there is just enough to keep you on your toes.  I think it has the perfect mix of everything that anyone would be looking for/ expecting in a theme park!  They have plenty of high intensity roller coasters for those, like me, who love the rush that comes with such rides.  They have plenty of activities, games, arcades, rides and attractions for children of all ages.  They have animal habitats, plus viewing and petting areas so it provides that zoo feel.  They have beautifullly manicured grounds and lush gardens that add to the overall appeal of the park.  There are also a good handful of water rides so it also has that water park feel as well.  There is also no shortage of bathrooms, stores/ shops, concessions and dinning areas, which to me is also just as important as the big attractions.  To me it has all the elements of a good theme park.  P.S. Sheikra is the BEST roller coaster!!!",

We have come to Busch Gardens and adventure Island on three different occasions and each time understaffed with lines hundred minutes plus for the main attractions, food lines 45 minutes plus. Bought the all you can eat wristband but literally standing in line for an hour to get a burger. They have summer nights which of course happens during the rainy part of the day so all the rides are closed the entire time we are here and would think they would keep all of the restaurant lines open since people have no place else to go but to eat... But no, again barely staffed and slow as heck. Complete waste of time and money. Very disappointing. They have taken away all the little things about this park that I loved. There is virtually nothing here for kids who are in between the kiddie rides and don't like roller coasters. Absolutely nothing. Wish I could get my money back for the money I spent. In my opinion they have made the ticket for Florida residence so inexpensive that too many people are coming and no one is having fun. Not sure what the solution to that one is but we won't be investing in these again and I would highly recommend you think twice about doing it as well. And we tried the park several different days and several different times including middle of the week, evening and weekends",

It was a great loss to leave it behind for the snow ridden lands of northern Michigan, let me tell you.\n\nBut upon my return some fifteen years later I realize it has not lost any of its magic. The shows that they run around the clock are wonderful from the bird shows to the Celtic dancers. I wouldn't have had it any other way.\n\nThere is a train that chugs you around the grounds, gondola that shows you the animals from the a bird's eye view, and roller coasters that will blow your mind. I spent a lot of time waiting in the lines, but trust me, they were worth it. \n\nMake sure you go with some friends, especially ones that will wait in lines with you (my brother bailed quite early), so you don't get bored, but other than that, it's a fun filled time.\n\n(P.S.

We went on a Thursday in January and there was almost no line for any of the rides,including the big roller coasters. \nWe ended up finding discount tickets on line before we went so we ended up saving 80 bucks total which was nice. \nWe definitely made up for it in the park. The food is very pricey and not that great but you kind of have to expect that at an amusement park. \nMy only wish would be that there were more rides that all sizes could ride. My oldest was .5 inch too tall for the bouncing section in sesame street and other smaller rides so there was very few rides that my two boys could go on together. We were all able to ride the Grover roller coaster which was our first roller coaster. \nThe park has many many animals exhibits which is awesome. I thought the train would bring us closer but we ended getting closer to the animal just by walking the park.",

Kumba is also 10 times more awesome than I remembered. Montu is also a favorite of mine. This time around I got to try Cheetah Hunt which I thought was really fun, but not very thrilling. I didn't get to try Falcon's Fury as everyone in my family chickened out and I didn't want to wait in line for over an hour by myself. I am highly considering getting a season pass so I can come enjoy these rides again and again.\n\nTip for future visitors: do not go anytime around Christmas. All rides have lines over an hour. Cheetah Hunt's line was over 2 hours long!!",

      "text": "This is one of those places that's a diamond in the rough, so to speak.\n\nBeing in Tampa it's not exactly close to Disney.  Maybe that's one of the good things about it.  This wasn't crowded on our weekday visit, which makes it even better.\n\nThis time we made our first stop at the safari.  We've always had a great time riding in the back of the truck and feeding the giraffes.  This was no exception.  It has changed slightly from years past though.  No longer do you feed the Ostrich or Bongo's.  While sad, the overall experience is still worth it.  Seeing some of these animals up close is, to me, the single best experience in the park.\n\nThe next best would be feeding the Lorey's.  These are hungry little colorful birds that, with a cup of nectar in your hand, flock all around you to get something to drink.  And if they leave a little present, that's a bonus.\n\nThere are coaster rides here, but that's not why we come.  For us it's really the animals and nature experience.  What I found missing are the Clydesdales.  We used to stop by their barn to see these gorgeous, mighty beasts.  Not this time.  I'm not sure if they cut that out or if we just couldn't find our way there.  \n\nThis will always be on my list of places to visit every time I'm in Florida.",

      "text": "Ok so I decided to trek my family 5 hours up to this place the weekend after July 4th. We arrived at the park to long long long lines and finally got in around 11. We got to get on two rides as the lines were insane and then all of a sudden all the rides stop as there was a huge cloud in the distance. We waited about an hour but nothing would reopen. Then it started raining. I had my 4 year old with me so we quickly rushed out. I was told that we needed to visit the ticket counter because I had just paid $164 for a one day pass for one of the children and they said I had to go to another line which was like a line at the trump poles back in 2016 and I was not having it. As my little one was wet already and irritated. So we got back to the hotel, I called Busch gardens and they told me they can't reissue the ticket over the phone that I should have waited in that line to get one. I was so upset. Spent over $1000 for a weekend and couldn't even go on any rides. This is not how customers should be treated. As my first visit there, it was very unpleasant. Now I wish I didn't buy two annual passes.\n\nI understand why they closed. I get they don't control the weather but not being able to help me get tickets for another time was messed up and unprofessional and without sympathy. So they wanted me to drive the 400 miles back to the park to get a rain check? Insane.",

All the things you look for in a good amusement park.\n\nToday we noticed that the rides were moving a bit slower than normal.  This was because the employees were wiping down the roller coaster trains (at least 1 row per ride) in an attempt to keep them well sanitized.  I thought this was a great thing to do given what's been going on.\n\nWe always take our refillable drink and popcorn tub with us.  We get free ice water throughout the day, and polyps only $1 when we refill it.\n\nThe all-day dining plan is well worth it.  A couple of meals, water every hour, and a snack here or there has you coming out ahead each and every time.\n\nToday we did the Serengeti Safari tour.  It was so much fun, and our 12:30 tour guide was awesome.  If you ever get a chance to do it, jump!\n\nBusch Gardens is fun.  We will continue to go back time and time again.",

I went a couple times during college and fell in love with it allll over again. \n\nBG is pretty much like an above-average zoo that also has roller coasters. It definitely feels quite a bit less \"fake\" than the parks in Orlando. \n\nI DO have to get on a soap box for a minute: \nThere used to be an actual Anheuser Busch brewery in the middle of the park! I have fond memories of smelling the sweet malt exiting the smokestacks and taking the tour and watching the tremendous canning/bottling lines. \n\nThen they closed it to save money. \n\nYou could still get 2 free samples of beer at the park though, which was quite nice. \n\nNow, as of a few weeks before this writing...that too, has ceased. \n\nAnheuser Busch's new owners (InBev, a Belgian brewing conglomerate) saw to it that the free beer samples were nixed. The \"beer school\" is over now too :( I hear they are now looking to sell Busch Gardens. \n\nWhat a sad story of what used to be the biggest American brewery. They used to have notices posted throughout the park reminding you that they were the only 100% American-owned large brewery in the US.",

We're huge fans of the Williamsburg location, and knowing that the one in Tampa has tons of animals, I was even super excited!  We were actually a little disappointed, as there weren't that many coasters T____T  We got to ride the Cheetah Hunt, the SheiKra, the Kumba, the Montu, and the Scorpion.  Honestly, the coasters were a little lackluster, as compared to the VA's counterpart, there was less of an adrenaline rush; maybe it's because it wasn't as fast enough?  Either way, I did enjoy seeing some of the animals, however to be up-close-and-personal, you would have to pay additional for the jeep/guided tours.  There were some shows that you could catch (such as 'Opening Night Critters,' 'A is for Africa,' etc.), and exclusive park experiences (at an additional fee; 'Serengeti Safari,' 'Penguin Insider,' etc.).  On a side note, beware of the aggressive seagulls!  The hubs ordered his usual funnel cake, and the seagulls were just at him (kind of scary!) - even the employees on staff were a little freaked out T____T  The park itself is also not well-kept (especially the bathrooms), so try to avoid the restrooms as much as you can!\n\n+beware of the aggressive seagulls! :O\n+not-so-clean restrooms T___T\n+minimal coasters\n+animal viewings at an additional charge",

We have a good time in everything we do. \nThe park is not nearly as clean or well maintained as other theme parks sadly. Many areas smelled like spoiled trash. The ride workers do not communicate well and most are not very friendly. We found many times they'd stand around socializing with one another and we had to ask things to clarify that they should be informing you of. The restaurants or food vendors also rushed you, acted like they could care less and we're not thorough in simple acts of service. \nParking was easy although over priced like everything else on the property. Preferred parking is not necessary as they offer a shuttle. Food is VERY sub-par!! \nWe bought the souvenir cups the day before at their Seaworld property (2 for $25) then refilled all day, $1.06 each time and that was great! There were lots of locations to refill there but not as many at Busch Gardens. But still recommend it. \nBring a backpack with cup inserts makes it easier. \nWe had so much fun on the rides! Our favorite part of the park. \nThe 'quick queue' is worth every penny to go straight to the front of the line on rides. \nWe rode three times the amount we would have without it! The 'Cheetah' ride was our favorite and best was riding it at night while the fireworks were going off! \nThe animals are adorable but if it rains (not sure if it's the lightening or possibility of) but they'll shut all the rides down and put animals away so plan accordingly. \nI hope they spend time and money to rehab this property soon. There's great elements about it but could be so much better!! \nTraining for their employees on excellence that other parks obviously expect would be a fantastic place to start!",

      "text": "We went on a Saturday and in July so I'm trying not to be too negative on my poor planning but we rode no coasters due to the 1-2 hour waits. We chose to do the train skylift shows and see the animals. We still enjoyed the day no worries. The park is huge and do not attempt to skip the shuttle it is a long walk to the park. We did the dinning because it was a special only $15 a person. Good choice the food is pricey and we ate at the smokehouse which I recommend highly. The animals were amazing so upclose even on the train ride. I will be back in cooler less crowded weather to ride the coasters this place is worth the drive",

Let me say it was a great decision we both made. We had such a great time. We honestly only waited on two rides for 30 minutes. Other then Cobra and some other ride that I can't remember, we never waited more then 10 minutes to get on any ride. We had lunch and to our surprise there was a show that started the minute we bought our lunch. The performers sand songs from the 50's and they were absolutely great. Honestly we could have not experienced a better day, It was a beautiful day. Recommend!",

      "text": "I haven't been in years, so I wasn't sure if I should rate overall or on my recent experience. Now I know sometimes things get closed for maintenance or weather or whatever, but this time like 4 rides were closed, including my favorite Montu. There were 3 rides I had never seen before but I think only one was under construction and the other two just weren't open so I missed a chance to ride them. And the ice skating show arena was closed and that was always my favorite place to watch shows. Partially because of air conditioning.\n\nThe animals are nice to look at but there's a lot more kid play areas than I remember. I imagine it's cheaper than grown up rides. Basically if you don't want to do water rides in January, I had Kumba, Scorpion (which is tiny) and Shiekra (which is scary tall). There wasn't a whole lot of thrill rides that were open. But I had a niece and nephew fully entertained. I know no park gives discounts if they have stuff closed, but it is pretty disappointing. This place with everything open and the desire to go on water rides is better in the summer.\n\nOh and before they were purchased by someone, they used to give out free small beers. And of course now that I'm over 21 I never got a chance for that. Damn!",

There are not attendants at every ride to place people into rows or if there is they do not properly do the math to make sure the ride is full every time it goes out. I think it's ridiculous that you have to pay practically an additional ticket in order to not have to stay in the lines. The locker system needs to be changed, if every person is required to use a locker then there needs to be more and the first hour should be free. The machinery for the lockers needs to be updated as well. The bathrooms are not kept neat or clean. The food is priced way to high. The facility overall needs an updated.",

So if you're not on line by say, 8:15 at the Zagora cafe, you'll be lucky to get your food by 9:00 when the park closes. And the lines at the places that close are just CRAZY starting at about 6pm.\n- SLOW SLOW SLOW service in many restaurant spots - especially Zagora Cafe. The workers here have zero enthusiasm - it's like they're walking through mud when they move. It's chicken fingers and hamburgers for goodness sake - why should it take so long?\n- because there aren't that many rides, the lines are incredibly long - many times even on the fast queue line so paying $60 per PERSON for the unlimited  fast queue was not exactly worth it since there was really only enough time to go on all of those rides once with maybe 2 roller coasters a couple of times.\n- the food, with the exception of the smokehouse, is not great.\n- very little shades spots to sit. The sun blared all day long - it was hot and really not much relief - not even in the gift shops - they all felt like they were unairconditioned (except for the one in the area with the birds). \n\nAll in all a fun day but I still prefer Universal and Disney parks over this one as there is much more variety and much better customer service.",

One of the big advertisements of Busch Gardens is the Safari experience, little did I know if was an additional $40 per person to do it, it's not part of the entrance fee.  Not that it mattered much because they wouldn't let the kids go so we couldn't go.  As we contemplated want to do next they have a little covered seating area right next to it so we went there to sit down.  Because we didn't pay for the Safari they kicked us out, they wanted to charge us more money to get the kids out of the heat.\n\nLast year we went to Animal Kingdom and that Safari ride wasn't an additional cost and the overall experience was much nicer.  We still have a trip to Sea World which is part of the family of parks that includes Busch Gardens, Sea World and Aquatica.  I have a feeling everything is going to cost extra.\n\nI'm sure teenagers will love the coasters (which I was kicked off because I had a camera) but next time we come down we will stick to the Disney Parks.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens really is an amazing place. But there are some areas where it just falls short of it being able to be compared to other parks in the Florida area. The first problem with Busch Gardens Tampa is the food options. Most theme parks have overpriced food but that's to be expected. The problem here is there lack of variety. When I go to Universal I can get way better food inside the park. At Busch Gardens inside one of the main dining places there are only 3 or 4 food options. The food was just hot only because it was under a heat lamp. They lined up food and drinks. This made the food not fresh at all. For how expensive it was I could easily go over to Burger King and get better food. I am not even talking about price. The portion sizes are pretty small. When you go to Disney or Universal you can go into restaurant and order many different types of food inside the park, while at Busch Gardens you feel like you are in a queue for another ride. The rides at Busch Gardens are amazing and I am excited to see there new hybrid coaster. Overall I give this park 3 stars simply because of the food options and just simple dinning. If you can get over that this park is easily 4/5 stars.",

But today we went again and it was sunny and hot and still the rides were closed. The park \"opened\" from 10-9, but we were only allowed 1/2 way through the park until 10:15 or 10:30, and had to wait for a guard to let us pass.  When we got in, most of the rides were still closed.  The flume was \"waiting for water.\"  Congo River Rapids was \"closed for annual maintenance.\"  (The wettest ride.  In July.  In Florida.). The Sky Ride opened at noon and until dusk, and when we finally got on it, there were \"technical difficulties\" which left us sitting in a cart for about 10-15 minutes.  One of the train stations was closed all day.  Other than Sheikra, most of the roller coasters were closed most of the day. (I think all were running by 5 or so.)  The rocking ship ride (I can't remember the name) was closed all day.  No cheetahs, hippo, or a few other animals were on display at all.  (The orangutan, gorilla, and tiger displays were great though.). Unlike in the past, you can't take a safari ride for free anymore.  Now it's an additional $30 charge per person for a \"Safari encounter.\"  One of the theaters had no show playing at this time.  Several attractions and a few rides closed around 7, though the park was open until 10.\n\nThe meal plan was good and we got our money's worth being that there wasn't much else to do but eat. Again, MUCH later, the roller coasters seemed to be up and running, but even then they were very slow...one \"cart\" would go up and there would be quite a wait until another went.  (The only exception seemed to be Sheikra.)  Falcon's Fury ran consistently all day, but that has an extremely slow-moving line for an extremely quick ride.\n\nOverall, it was nice to see, but we won't be going back.

Definitely had a blast with that. Overall, I love coming here. I would say, however, if you don't like roller coasters, there's not much else to do except look at the animals. There are a few lectures on how animals are taken care of and stuff going on at certain times, but there aren't really any 'shows' like at other theme parks (at least from what I've noticed). Also, when it starts to rain, it's definitely hard to get on any rides because almost all of them have to be shut down until the weather gets better.

      "text": "2/19/19 10:30am Preferred and handicapped parking SOLD OUT once again.   Wtf is the point in preferred parking?  What is the point in Platinum Passes???  Why pay all the extra money!?!!  Busch Gardens has changed in such a bad way in so many ways.   They changed their menus.   The lines are beyond long for EVERY single thing.   And when you call to complain....     ... it's pathetic.   They tell me I can go wait in line at the customer service center but that's an hour long wait too.   Really?  I need to wait an hour to complain?   Not a good way to make an unhappy customer happy.   \n\nOh and yesterday the rides kept going down and down and down multiple times.   \n\n\n\n6/9 here again... why? Why ??? Why????  80 mins for Cheetah....   upstairs of the outpost reserved.   What a joke.\n\n1/27 here again.    This time the bar is all out of everything.   It's 11:30 am and the lines for rides are 55 min wait lol...    yeah...   just spent an additional $300 so my family can \"enjoy\" the day.   Smh...   this park.... why do I keep coming back!!!\n\n\n11/11 - Here again.   After last incident BG gave us skip the line passes.   Only good for one line jump per ride (not quick que unlimited).   We used them yesterday and it was an ok day.   Today the kids were in line for Cobras Curse.   Estimated wait showing?  65 mins.   Actually time? 2 hours 5mins!!!   Yes my children spend half a day waiting to ride a ride !!!!    Why?  Lightening?   ZERO.   It was Busch Gardens favorite recording \"Due to technical difficulties\".   \n\nYesterday they removed the Platinum parking without notice.   That was a total nightmare trying to navigate two handicapped folks about a mile to get into the park.   I sent a message to guest relations...   (nobody cares.).   We will purchase quick que unlimited for the kids tomorrow ($150.00 extra) because without it the Park is a complete waste of time.   Unless you want to spend all day waiting in line.   \n\n\n\n\n\nCompletely awful!!!!   I can understand weather but holy sh!t...    every single ride \"Down for technical difficulties...\".  Omg....   we've been here two days and our children have got on 3 rides.    Between weather and \"technical difficulties.\"   We paid $1500 PLUS HOTEL for me, my husband, and 3 children.    This park has gone down hill BIGTIME!   \n\nAlso our kids went to get on the SHEIKRA and they were in the seat and the ride shut down.   The tech workers are there working within a few minutes but it too ma few hours.   They tried to go back and they were told NO too small.  I've posted photos.   It's close but NO....   \n\nI am headed to customer service to voice my complaints and I bet they don't do crap! \n\n2/17/19 here again.   Got here at 10:00am and preferred parking and handicapped was FILLED.   So that leaves me 7 months pregnant and my handicapped daughter to walk and walk and walk.   I tell the guy directing traffic but he just screamed at us.   I call customer service and they recommend I can pay $50 for the motorized scooter!?!  Whaaaat?! I pay $200 per month for 5 platinum passes.   The like wait right now for Cheetah is 70 mins.   Thank God I bought skip the line for $1000.00 yeah that's right $1000 additional otherwise my kids would get to ride on 5 rides all day.   What a nightmare this place is.... oh yay I just\nwaited 1.5 hrs to get a Cuban sandwich in the Dragon Fire Grill and \"sorry we are all out..\" so I go to get a pizza \"15 min wait..\"",

Lots of roller coasters for bigger kids and adults. \n\nTwo critiques/requests: more non-coaster rides for adults. I'm pregnant and can basically only go on the merry go round. And more vegan/gluten-free food options at the restaurants. \n\nPro tip- get the reusable drink cup and popcorn bucket. Refills are $.99 for the drinks and $2 for the popcorn.",

Having done so, we were able to bypass the lines and enter the park without much wait. \n\nOur first stop was the Cheetah Hunt! One of the newest attractions at the park and with a wait of 50 mins, it was still well worth it. \n\nMy favorite of the rides-- Sheikra, definitely on another level of heart-stopping fun! I was not ready for the adrenaline rush this ride provided! \n\nI enjoyed seeing the animals: the lions, the tigers, the dancing elephant, all super cute!",

      "text": "So much wrong with Busch Gardens I will have to make a list. For one thing we have not been been to this park in over 15 years. I recall it being a bad experience but not as bad as this time.\n\nThey offered for $99 the park and adventure island a pass that would last until the end of the year. So you think this is too good to pass up.\n\nWell please pass this up.\n\n1. When you get off I4 it should take 15 minutes to get to the park. We got there at 10:30 but physically got through the gates at 12:00 basically 1.5 hours just to get there from 6 miles away. Remember its Saturday they open at 10:00 why it gets hotter?\n\n2. They post online parking $20 which is a ripoff but it actually cost $22 for a dirt lot I expected this.\n\n3. You wait on line for everything here. I doubt this place has changed in at least 15 years maybe even longer.It appears no money into this place\nSo we get on long line to get through security I get up there and they say because I have a pocket knife on my keys I need to go back to car or pay money to put in lock box and get in line again. I  could not understand the security guard I asked him a few times to repeat but could not understand him. Just like Universal they mumble.\n\nThe pocket knife is basically smaller then a key. its more of a finger nail file. But these they act like its weapon just like Universal. Disney doesnt think so but BG does. I hide knife and got back in line this time new guy didnt even look at keys.No signage again.\n\n4. So by the time we get in park its 12:30. We get a map and try to find someplace to go, the map is like a map you get at dennys. Its cartoonish and useless completely useless. I am usually the best person with maps this thing was useless. \n\n5. When you finally get a human to point you in a direction and you try to follow the signs you walk in the heat until you hit a crossroad and no signs again. You finally find someone tells you where to go. All through the park its like this. \n\n6. Ok so we finally make it to the skyride, I figured it was hot as hell we  could get on that thing and go for a cool ride. We get there and there sign and a cone says closed due to weather. We had no idea walked for 20 minutes to this place.\n\nIts like 1:00 by now the sky is overcast. We hear on a speaker that is playing fake animal noises all the time a small voiced person saying due to weather they are closing all the rides. You can barely hear this person.\n\n7. Every ride is closed down no rain yet just overcast skys. I mean everything closed bumper cars, train, carosel, everything. This was like this for like an hour and half. You know what was open the carnival games, gift shops and restaurants. Anything they can suck more money out of you was open.\n\n8. We finally get on train they took 20-25 minutes to get people on the train. It was already full just adding like last 10 people that alone took 20-25 minutes 10 people.\n\n9. They have obnoious guy on the speaker when you are on the train, who makes you want to jump off the train. You are forced to keep listening 20-25 minutes before we leave station. They also pump out spanish for a long time in case you really want to go nuts.\n\n10. We finally get on a raft ride after waiting 1 1/2 hours in line for ride.I had been on this thing 15 years ago no different no storage on the raft so pay locker\n\n11. We get on bumper cars its ok line normal, not a big ride.\n\n12. My family gets hungry we stop in for a  burger they have a sign with burger, fry and drink on it $12.99 I think wow this isnt too bad. Wrong does not include drink in small writing says add a coke. Who the hell makes a sign so misleading, we get a small cup of water.\n\nThe fries are the worse fries I have ever had. I dont know how they screw up fries but they were hard tasted bad. The burger was as bad as the fries really bad. I had gotten mine with chicken fingers on it. chicken fingers hard and had fat.No quality control most go in garbage.\n\n13.We were eating it started raining slightly, meaning all the rides off again. They were off at least 1/2 hour.\n\n14. Didnt do anything after that looked at the sleeping animals they looked really sad.Tiger was vibrating like it was sick who knows.\n\n15. Left at 6:00 the heat is unbareable. Very little spray coolers and only saw one water fountain.\n\nThis Busch Gardens needs to shut down. In 15 years it has gotten much worse, unless you like coasters there is nothing to do here. In fact the safara ride in the jeeps is gone since last time I was here. \n\nSigns saying dont throw items on track really dangerous.\n\nPlay fake animal sounds that are annoying & repetive since the animals are so docile they could never make noise.\n\nThey have a lot of land for animals not even used. I have been here in the past 20 years maybe even longer. The land use for the few animals they do have is a waste of real estate. 20 plus years and no changes.\n\nThey have an app its the website.Should have alert when things are closed, hell no just walk in circles.",

The beautiful birds fascinated me and I related way too much to the lazy sloth. \"Crotters Inn Charge\", one of the shows, was very interesting. I can't imagine how anyone could train an animal so well. The band show was also very intriguing. The dancers and singers looked like they were have a lot of fun on stage which brought a new kind of light to the audience's faces. I would love to go again with my husband around Christmas to see the lights again. They were placed beautifully around the park bringing an early Christmas spirit to all who witnessed.",

The pass gives you free parking vs $25, and 10% off food and everything else. There's also two 7 ounce free samples of beer available at either the Serengeti Outlook Cafe or the Garden Gate Cafe. We also belong to the brew club where we can get 20 ounce beers for $2.87 including tax, and including a special Stein stored on premise. We don't do coasters, but we love the train ride which rides through the Serengeti, viewing up close, giraffes, zebras, rhinos, and the like. We like eating the bbq in Stanleyville, and the sampler platter is plenty for both of us. If you're not aware, water and sparkling water is free throughout the park, and we bring in insulated containers for that. The food and wine festival is great, the beerfest, and all the special activities year round, including free concerts. No, we don't get bored of the animals, and it's better exercise than a treadmill!",

We get to the park around 10:30 and see wait times over 50 minutes. We all decide to buy unlimited quick queues and a Serengeti adventure. Combined, we all spent well over $500. We get the opportunity to do ONE ride with the quick queue before our Seregenti tour. After the tour, the park was closed due to poor weather conditions. We waited over an hour before we decided we didn't want to waste the rest of our day, since we drove so far, waiting to see if the rides will ever reopen. When we proceed to get our rain check tickets, we asked for a refund or a rain check ticket for the quick queue. How is it we spend over $500 at your park and two of us pay you annually and you don't do the slightest to help your guests who spent $90 per person buying a rip off quick queue we used ONCE. Unless your guest service gets better, you're losing at least 4 guests and two pass holders. We'll drive to Orlando next time and go to Universal. Thanks for nothing.",

Both the train and the sky ride are good for those that cannot ride the coasters or the crazier rides. \n\nThey have plenty of parking in the lot and you can select regular parking and use the tram or select preferred and be closer to the park entrance.

Had to eat when we left the park even after checking menu options prior to purchase. 3 of their biggest rides were closed, very disappointing experience for nearly a $1000 price tag for  our family. Money would have been much better spend elsewhere. We won't be back.",

      "text": "We have been pass holders for over a year and pay month to month. We were very excited once we heard Busch Gardens was reopening after the closure for Covid-19. They kept us informed throughout the closure and told us the days closed would be added to our passes and they upgraded our pass to the next tier. It all sounded great.\n\nWe made our plans to drive over 4 hrs from Homestead, FL. To then only be left totally disappointed with the park. I had reserved Saturday and Monday for Busch Gardens. We were leaning towards to go more on Monday since possibly less people. A few days before leaving I get an email that they no longer open Mondays. Ok fine so we went on Saturday. The park seemed pretty packed considering there's a pandemic going on. We took advantage of our first \"upgrade\" which was preferred parking. Which I guess now everyone has that and it was packed and end up walking more than regular parking. We get to the kiosks to get our second \"upgrade\" which was the Serengeti tour. The machine wouldn't lets us so went to a window and was told that all animal encounters are cancelled because of COVID-19. Hmm ok. So we enter the park and head to our 1st ride, Cheetah Hunt. What do we arrive to? 3 people standing at the entrance telling us it's closed all day. Ok so next ride.. Cobras curse.. 60 min wait.. next ride Kumba.. 90 min wait.. Tigris 60.. and so on. While trying to look for a ride to go on, we saw no personnel advising people about their masks. Everyone was wearing them incorrectly making us feel very unsafe at this point so we left.\n\nOn our way out we visited customer service to advise of our experience. They just gave me a card with an email and address. I sent an email.. no response to this date. We called customer service to cancel our passes and get our money back for the months closed because this was not what we signed up for. No one is willing to help us over the phone. You can't even reach someone when you call. You have to request a callback which is like 4 hours later. We have been on the phone we're the re just says they can't do anything and place us on mute and disappear. Very disappointing that Busch Gardens is doing business this way.",

Most of what people have been saying is false. The only issue that really effected me was the lack of beverage/snack bars, however it is understandable seeing as we are coming out of a pandemic, and they are Lilly short staffed. There were still some snack places opened periodically around the park, however the majority of them were closed. All of the staff working were extremely nice, and I didn't see any staff without masks (that is not to say that none of them weren't wearing masks, I just didn't see any without one). Also, many of the lines for rides (with the exception of cheetah hunt, one of the most popular rides) had extremely short wait times. During the 5 hours me and my group were there, we got to go on 6 rides (we did not have fast passes, however we decided not to go on cheetah hunt). Not many of the people who were there (not including staff) were wearing a mask, however if you think that would bother you, just wait until COVID is behind us. If you feel safe enough to be around people without masks, then I'm sure you will have a great time.",

      "text": "I can remember going to Busch Gardens when the big thrill attractions were the Scorpion and the Python, which seems laughably ludicrous now. It's been fascinating to watch how the park continues to update and change itself. When they do add new items they are world-class attractions. When the first dive coaster to be placed in the United States was constructed where did it go? That would be Sheikra. Where is the tallest freestanding drop tower in North America? That's Falcon's Fury. What's great about Bush Gardens is that even if you aren't a thrillseeker there is still lots of entertainment. I've brought older people here who were thrilled with riding the train, viewing the animals, and seeing the shows. I've brought young children here who enjoyed all of that, as well as the children's area. And of course I've come here with thrillseekers, who have lots of options for going on rides. The Kumba was the first \"real\" roller coaster that I ever went on, so it holds a special place in my heart (even though I thought I was going to have a heart attack the first time I rode it). Montu is a still thrilling coaster where you hang beneath the track. Sheikra loves to torture you as it dangles you on the edge of a drop that is almost straight down from a ridiculously tall height. Cheetah Hunt is my favorite roller coaster by far. On three separate occasions it launches you and in multiple places you get amazing airtime. The only huge misstep I feel that the park has made was with the wooden coaster Gwazi. I absolutely hated that ride the one and only time I rode it because it was so painful. I am thrilled that they are getting rid of it and am I looking forward to seeing what will replace it.\n\nBusch Gardens also does a great job with their special events. Howl-o-scream at Halloween seems to get better every year. I like the wide variety of themes that the haunted houses have, from crazy clowns to voodoo inspired bayous. They go above and beyond with the theming for these events.  My favorite this year was the employees dressed as plants who would hide in the bushes to scare people walking by. They got me when I was exiting a ride and I couldn't stop laughing afterwards. Christmas town is a wonderful way to end the year. I love looking at Christmas lights, of which there are thousands and thousands in the park during this event.\n\nThe only complaint I have about how the park is run is with the ride photos. The employees will reprimand you if you try and take a photo of the proof of you on a ride. It is such a stark contrast with how Disney operates. Disney not only lets you take cell phone pictures of the proofs, but they also let you look at them online. Sometimes I want to spend money and buy one, but sometimes I just want a crappy cell phone shot of it. Having the picture police yell at me makes me never want to buy them here. That is a minor complaint that doesn't detract from my love of this wonderful park. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Busch Gardens.",

I had a horrible experience this Saturday night for Howl-O-Scream, to start it off, very few people were wearing their masks and even less were wearing it correctly. The mask policy was barely enforced and the social distancing guidelines were blatantly disregarded, lines were back to back with less than a foot between parties and people with their masks down right up on your back vaping in lines. Speaking of lines, the lines for each ride went well over 150 minutes per ride, literally 2 and a half hours to ride a single rollercoaster when there are supposed to be reservations (reservations that no one even looked at when we went through the gate or bought a parking ticket!). What is the point of reservations if the park doesn't care if there are several thousand people rubbing up on each other in every line spreading the virus everywhere. Worst experience I have ever had at Busch gardens and I will never recommend the park to anyone again after last nights shit show.",

      "text": "This is a great theme park in Florida that has a lot to offer.  From roller coasters to animals to safari adventures there is something for everyone.  \n\nThe park has definitely evolved over the decades but it is still a lot of fun for kids and adults of all ages.  \n\nWhat I like the most are the roller coasters and the animals.  They also treat injured animals from the wild, and you can see them at work in the facility where they do diagnostics and surgery.  \n\nIn the old days, they allowed you to sample beers, but today you have to buy them.  They actually have some craft beers too in the park.  They are expensive but they do taste nice paired with a pretzel or BBQ if thats your thing.  \n\nIve been coming to this park close to 40 years now, and still enjoy it.  My kids had a blast on this last visit.  We came on a Monday after Spring Break was over and there was no lines.  The weather was overcast and no rain, perfect theme park weather.  \n\nTickets can be pricey, so if you are coming with a group you can save money by buying an annual pass and getting guest passes for 50% off, and you also get free parking.  For the 5 of us, we saved around $100 vs buying 5 regular priced tickets.  \n\nOverall, this is a great park, which definitely rivals the big parks in Orlando.  Its arguably better in a lot of ways.  Definitely worth the visit.",

With the pressures we have been under for so long since COVID, we decided that we would give our children a lifetime memory and forget about struggles for awhile.  With a bit of assistance from friends, we purchased single day tickets, two UNLIMITED Quick Queues, two all day meal plans for our kids (now 3 and 10), and of course, parking.  \nUpon entrance, there was no clear direction from anyone to let us know what ticketing counter to report to for prepaid tickets.  Crowds were close.  I wonder it it was an overstaffed issue or a capacity issue, but the ratio of park attendants to guests was horrible.  My kids got one turkey leg that they shared and two drinks each for the price of two meal plans due to the lack of options and long waits.  Paper maps aren't given, the app won't load them, and phone pictures of the map are difficult to use adequately, so much of our day was lost to being lost.  When attendants could be found, no one seemed to know how to tell you where to go.\nMy daughter has asked all week when she was going to get to see the animals.  She is obsessed and I couldn't wait to experience this place with her.  The only animals we were able to find were birds that you couldn't interact with and a couple giraffes after dark on a the train ride (that we spent an hour trying to ride.  I am heartbroken.  Especially since she didn't get to see the big cats she has been hung up on for quite some time.\nMy son is on the autistic spectrum, but there is something about roller coasters that transforms him.  I pumped up everything about BG because I really believed it.  After spending around $120 per person for the Unlimited Quick Queues, we could not wait to see that side of a kid we have worked hard to pull from the lure of depression.  After being at the park from 12:00-9:00, my son had managed only to ride the Tigris because of  wait lines in other areas of the park.  He had a small drawstring bag he was able to store in every ride at SeaWorld, but was not allowed at sister park, Busch Gardens?  Hummm... this turned into a nightmare for our kid who had to lose his place in line and then go through waiting in the Quick Queue AGAIN.  \nBy the time we were able to make it to the exit, there was nobody available to help us at customer service, since it was after closing time.  Customer service wait times are ridiculous and there isn't much that can be done online.  They could at least hire customer service chat reps.\nAnyway, I am disappointed and ashamed of myself.  I should have held onto the money spent here and used it for necessities, but I felt we all needed a break from reality for our mental health and wellbeing.  Who knows, we may never get another chance to do something like this as a family again..  We felt that the memories we make together can never be taken away.  I just wish everything could have been happier!  My kids got used birthday presents and we gave them  one cheap gift each this year for their birthday. \n They have been my warriors.  They DESERVED to be regular kids for a day. Around $800 later and there is nothing but regret.\nI wish I could have a do-over.\nVisited  3/19/22",

Upon entering the park we decided to purchase a water bottle for 14.99 in which you could refill for 99\u00a2 throughout the park. We are very glad we did because a water is $4-5 and it was a HOT day!! Our only complaint is it was very hard to find the places to fill it up, and when we did the line was insanely long. The wait times were long, but we expected it. We did watch the ice skating show and it was AMAZING!! Overall a great day!!",

      "text": "I honestly can't complain about a theme park that offers Florida resident passes for the price of a one-day admission and is located DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY APARTMENT. Shizzz, I'm a fan!\n\nYeah, it's kinda small. But that's what's nice about BG. It's got a small-time, not too commercialized, not overwhelming feel. I can go here, spend two or three hours walking around and be happy. And then come back the next day. And the next. And.... you get the picture. I have no life. That's okay.\n\nMy favorite ride is SheiKra (duh) but I also love the beautiful animals and African theme. This place is a must for animal lovers. I do feel a little bad that they have to be surrounded by annoying tourists and ear-splitting \"theme\" music all day... but I do know they are well cared-for and that's most important.\n\nSometimes this place is hit-or-miss. Most recently, we came on a Thursday afternoon and the place was dead and all the vendors were closed. They closed the rides when it started raining. AKA absolutely nothing to do. We spent most of our time at the Crown Colony restaurant, which is one of my favorite food places along with the candy store. Despite everything else being closed I still just liked being there. Where else can you say that?\n\nSo, in conclusion: buy a resident pass and go here. Ride the rides. Spend money (Florida's economy needs it, and BG is one of the best things Tampa's got going for itself let's be honest). Have fun. Take pictures of the animals, get some exercise walking around and learn something new. Don't take it all too seriously, just enjoy!",

      "text": "I wish I had read some of these reviews before planning this trip. We love Busch Gardens and have been here many times. However, if you are concerned about COViD, it's the worst place to be. It made me infuriated to see the lack of enforcement of the social distancing or mask policies. The place was full of people who wore their masks under their nose, on their chins or even around their necks. I did not see a single employee enforcing proper mask wearing. It is not a political thing. If this is the park rule, ones beliefs should not supersede the rules. It is not fair to those of us who made the trip because we're were informed that there were proper precautions in place. It made me so uncomfortable being there. \n\nAlso, the place was so crowded. There is supposed to be a reservation system to limit the park attendance. So much for that! They didn't even check if we had reservations, which we did, when we came in. \n\nWe went to Sea World San Diego a few months ago and were so pleased with the precautions they were taking there that we assumed it would be the same at Busch Gardens. WRONG! If you are concerned about COVID, don't go to Busch Gardens right now.",

      "text": "The two stars are big ones - one star for the care that they give the animals and one for the performers - especially the ice skaters.  The three \"not stars\":  One for the crowds and inability to manage them through increasing ride frequency.  The sky ride was closed so the train was the only transportation available.  Only one train running and a half hour wait for it.  During the ride, the engine had an issue getting up an extremely slight grade, spinning its wheels, making the wait even longer (was the engineer brand new or was it the first time the train was this loaded?).  Second is the attitude of the non-performers.  The people at the food areas were sour and unfriendly.  Third is the cost.  The basic ticket prices were expensive enough, they they screw you for $25 to park.  Really?  Granted we went during the Christmas crush (the lights were beautiful), but you'd think after all these years, they would be prepared for the crowds.",

      "text": "We have certainly been to Busch Gardens before as it is one of our favorite places for roller coasters. This time was not a good visit. In six hours we managed to ride one roller coaster. The rest of the time we waited when there was not been much of a line.   It was a hot summer day but not as hot as it had been for the previous week. They were running roller coasters empty according to young man on duty. Doing quality controls I suppose.  After waiting for the better part of 30 minutes with no line we finally got on and road Sheikra. At our second roller coaster there was a sudden downpour of rain without lightning. No one was able to ride for an hour. A number of rides were closed down and there were many indoor attractions that were closed.  Another hour past by and we Heard an announcement overhead that due to weather concerns that all rides were being canceled. People started going into shops and the weather never materialized. So eventually we decided to leave. For the six hours we were there, we went on one ride.  When we passed by the office when we were leaving, it was closed up tight so we couldn't even ask for a rain check for another day. We paid $80 a person to go on one roller coaster plus $25 parking. . Very disappointing.",

The food options are far from gourmet but it gets you through the day.  The price for a one day admission is the same as the Fun Pass which allows you to go back multiple times until 12/31. It is definitely one of the best valued parks around. Sometimes there are even groupon deals as well.  You can't beat that!! \n\nMy favorite roller coaster is Montu.  I also enjoy the newer coaster Cheetah Hunt. Sheikra is one of the most unique roller coasters I have ever been on!!!  I love seeing the different animals. \n\nThere is a cool app that even tells you wait times and an interactive map. Make sure your phone is charged :) \n\nOverall it's a fun time for all and well worth it!",

      "text": "I had the opportunity to visit Busch Gardens Tampa for the first time back in April, I've been a coaster enthusiast for 7 years and this park had been on my bucket list for a long time and I was not disappointed. This was my first time in the state of Florida and I came down specifically for BGT. Out of the almost dozen parks I've visited so far, this was the most picturesque. Every area of the park is beautifully and extensively themed, I would even say it's just a step below Universal level theming. Pantopia is an especially gorgeous area and the park is just covered in greenery. Now let's talk about the coasters. Specifically the B&M coasters; Kumba, Montu, and Sheikra. Kumba was one of my most anticipated coasters on this trip and it was my first sitdown model from B&M, I absolutely loved every second of it!! It is incredibly forceful, it's generally very smooth given its age, there's just a certain way of making a B&M smoother but I did not find it to be rough at all. I love all the inversions including the interlocking corkscrews and the zero g roll aptly nicknamed the hell roll, ridiculous amount of whip especially in the back row, during my short two day visit, I rode Kumba 14 times, absolutely phenomenal coaster! Now for Montu, the B&M invert. This is now my favorite invert and for good reason, it's also incredibly forceful and fast paced, the highlight inversion being the batwing. The way it pulls you into it in the back row is crazy, in fact none of my rides on Montu or Kumba were anywhere but the back row. And the fact that they had to add a trim brake before the batwing must've meant it was initially too intense for riders. This was also my first invert with an immelmann, those are super fun inversions especially on inverts, I got 16 rides on Montu during my visit and it's going to be hard to top it as my favorite invert at least until I have the opportunity to ride inverts overseas. Last but not least is the dive coaster Sheikra, america's first dive coaster. This was my second dive coaster overall, the first being Valravn at Cedar Point and I definitely preferred Sheikra. Valravn may be taller and feature more inversions but one of B&M's best characteristics is airtime and the newer vest restraints tend to hinder the airtime you could be getting while the traditional restraints on Sheikra allow for max airtime on the drops, once again, especially in the back row. 7 rides on Sheikra in  2 days, 5 back row rides. You really can't go wrong with this park. Even if you don't like coasters, there's so much else to see and do, and it wouldn't be a Busch park without the animals and there are plenty of those. And let's not forget, for the extreme thrill seekers; you can't pass up an opportunity to ride Falcon's Fury, not many places can you get a face first dive especially from a height of 335ft. As you can probably tell by this lengthy review, I absolutely enjoyed every second of my visit to Busch Gardens and will definitely return also to check out Iron Gwazi. Thank you to the staff at BGT for making this such an amazing place to visit. Highly recommend this park to anyone!!",

      "text": "MIDWESTERNERS BEWARE: this is NO Cedar Point. I was very excited to visit here while on vacation, but found it to be severely lacking. The roller coasters were simply okay. Some of them were closed for seemingly no reason. The place is also a maze with random dead ends and scarce signage to help you navigate the park. Doesn't flow well and makes it hard to find the things you want to do, even when looking a their maps on the website. The food was overpriced, as expected for an amusement park, but was also terrible!! Our food was burnt and the worker lied about it even though we could see the dark brown/black spots. The animals scattered throughout the park were honestly sad to see. Don't get me wrong, I love animal exhibits as much as the next person, but them placed right by busy rides and games makes no sense. Overall this is not worth the money alone. Buy the citypass to save your coins and go when the parking is free if you want to check it out.",

      "text": "For someone who doesn't like roller coasters, and that is really what Busch Gardens are known for, you would think that the day could get boring, but not at all. First of all, admittance. You can buy an annual pass for as little as $12 a month, pretty nice if you live in the Tampa or St Pete. area. If you are from out of state, I'm not sure on what a one day ticket cost per person, but I'd say somewhere around $100 most likely. Right now its a busier time than normal because of Howl- 0- Scream going on until the end of October. For animal lovers, there is a lot to do and see, definitely bring a quality camera with you. The 65 mile Serengeti  Safari is a lot of fun and the animals are very well cared for. There are a few very large roller coasters, you could not pay me enough to even try that out, but if you like coasters, they do have those here too. The Congo river rapids are a lot of fun, prepare to get wet, its basically like going whitewater rafting in the west, but in a controlled environment. My favorite thing to do at any theme park is to try out a different dining experience each time. There is a new Giraffe bar where you can watch the Giraffes as you eat. The Dragon Fire grill and pub restaurant seems to be the most popular, they had pizzas, chicken platters, Asian cuisine, really good desserts. The only downside to Tampa this time of year is the heat, you have no protection from the sun and it is 100 degrees until November, so it would be best to come here during the winter, you will have more energy and feel better walking around, because it is miles and miles of walking.",

Can't get much better than that! \n\nOn a Thursday, I arrived early to the park (prepaid $25 for parking) and they let us in right around 0950. I came with an agenda and I was able to ride all the big rides (except Kumba which was down for maintenance) in 2 1/2 hours!! I even rode a few of them twice! \n\nEveryone had to wear a mask and I definitely heard staff reminding people to wear them properly more than once. Hand sanitizer is also everywhere! Social distancing was enforced as they left seats open between parties. A few rides I got to ride all by myself literally. The ride with the longest wait was Cheetah hunt, but it was TOTALLY worth it!! Every other ride was pretty much a walk-on earlier in the day. Never had to wait more than about 5 minutes. \n\nThe animals are beautiful. The park is beautiful. I had a REALLY fun time and I'll for sure be back. Can't wait to conquer Iron Gwazi!",

We had the all day dining deal and it wasn't even worth it to go to a different food place only to find out they are serving the exact same thing, it's like going to your kids school and grabbing cafeteria food. In animal habitats, the animals look depressed and overheated. Habitats are really small and just overall cruel to creatures who need more space to roam and do what they were naturally born to do. They also look very lonely and bored, most habitats have one animal inside which is what probably causes them to be depressed. They need interaction with more of their own kind. Busch Gardens Tampa is terrible in comparison to the one in Williamsburg, VA where you can have twice as much fun and the conditions are better in all areas compared to Tampa. Don't waste your money paying almost as much as you would pay for Disney or Universal studios! Also, social distancing and covid ? That does not exist at all, if you aren't fully vaccinated stay at home and be safe, not ONE PERSON was wearing a mask. Never coming back again.",

I purchased two meal plans costing me over $80 only to receive hamburgers on soggy bread with stale fries . I was even told by one worker that it's the same food they serve to employee in the back for $2 .

      "text": "YELP REVIEW #1100\n\nBusch Gardens has been a 5-star experience for me ever since I was a little kid and visiting the Tampa area during summer vacations with my family. My grandparents used to live in the small town of Wildwood north of Ocala, and our summer vacations consisted of trips to see them followed by days at the beach and days at Busch Gardens.\n\nThe park opened way before my time in 1959 as a special hospitality area for Anheuser-Busch of Tampa, with it's famed tasting room and bird sanctuary. In 1965 Busch Gardens opened the area known as Serengeti Plains, and stocked the Plains with African wildlife which were allowed to roam freely. Over the years, Busch Gardens has continued to focus on its tropical landscape, exotic animals, and thrill ride amusements to draw visitors.\n\nBusch Gardens is a relatively small park with 335 acres inside their fences. That includes 25 total rides, of which 8 are classified as roller coasters, and 3 are water attractions. The park hosted well over 4 million people last year, placing in the Top 20 of the most-visited theme parks in the US and in the Top 25 worldwide.\n\nFlorida Resident annual passes cost $156 for Busch Gardens, and that includes free parking, discounts on dining, shopping, and special admission events, and no blackout dates. In my book this is THE best value for any amusement park in Florida, and one of the best amusement park experiences in the country.\n\nYes, it has changed a lot over the years -- fan favorites such as the Anheuser-Busch tasting room and Rhino Rally are long gone, and the Park has confirmed that the Gwazi wooden roller coaster is coming down soon. In their place, new attractions such as SheiKra, Cheetah Hunt, and Falcon's Fury have sprung up around the park. Today Busch Gardens is a combination African wildlife exhibit, thrill ride / coaster junkie experience, and some high quality song / dance / ice skating / acrobatic production shows.\n\nBusch Gardens has over ten different themed areas within the park, and more than a dozen animal attraction spots. There is now an Animal Care Center on the premises, and park visitors are welcome to watch the veterinarians as they perform exams and medical procedures on the wildlife. The park has some behind-the-scenes tours which allow visitors to venture out onto the Serengeti on specially-built Busch Gardens vehicles, and feed some of the animals.  \n\nAs for the thrill rides, hang on to your seats because Busch Gardens is one of the best coaster-junkie meccas in America. Rides such as Kumba and Montu, are now joined by Cheetah Hunt, SheiKra, and Falcon's Fury for screaming good times by all. Busch Gardens still has the Skyride and the Serengeti Railway for those who enjoy a slightly tamer ride.\n\nIf you prefer live-action shows then you'll find a constantly-changing number of family-friendly productions featuring costumed characters, live animals, singing, dancing, and acrobatic performers. The shows change by season, so make sure that you check the daily schedule to see what's happening.\n\nThroughout the year Busch Gardens has a number of special events for their guests, and those include Christmas Town, Howl-O-Scream, the Real Music Series, Bands, Brew & BBQ, Viva La Musica!, Summer Nights, and a Food & Wine Festival to name a few.\n\nBusch Gardens has been incredibly generous to the Tampa Bay Yelp community for the past several years, offering us a limited number of free VIP admission tickets and front-of-the-line passes during the Holiday season, and for Howl-O-Scream. They are class people, running a fantastic home-town amusement park.",

But I have become very disappointed in how they are running things, the vibe has changed dramatically. Not only have they been nickel and dimming the public but the customer service has taken a dive. They used to hand out free beer to the adults, those days are over... The food quality is not up to par considering the hefty price tag. I recently called customer service to verify when my annual card would expire, they provide me with the date making me believe they would stop charging my account, two months go by and I realize my account was still be charged, I call customer service thinking this was just an honest mistake I'm sure they'll reimburse me. Lol, never happened, they just said I should've been aware of the change after signing up, sorry. So what was the point of my original call??? Doesn't matter anymore, I felt misled and promised myself I'd never get the pass again. Bring the kids, I'm sure they'll love it. Just feel that the magic that used to be Busch Gardens is no longer there. My two cents.",

We never even got to ride one  ride! I feel I basically paid for a walk through a park with Christmas lights and a 20 minute ice skating show ( show was excellent).  Way over priced for what was there. I'll never go again and I definitely don't recommend. I know Covid takes a toll, but put it on the website so people have an option to decide if 1-2 hour waits for the 1-3 open rides is worth the cost. We do one Christmas event and choose this one.

What is the point of a reservation and buying it online if you are going to let anyone inside? \n\nMy bf and I had the quick passes and the lines for those were about 40mins to an hour. So it felt like a regular line. There are spots in the park for people to buy quick passes as well throughout the park any time they would like which is why I took so long. \n\nThe food and wine festival there was my favorite part. You did have to purchase that separate. \n\nYou have to wear masks at ALL times except eating or drinking. They will not start a ride unless everyone puts it on. \n\nThere is social distancing on the rides as well.",

I went with a friend who had gotten our tickets already but honestly I probably wouldn't pay the park fee to come back again. I wouldn't spend all of that money just to ride a 30 second ride.\n\nI do have to admit that the lines ran pretty fast and efficiently. The longest I waited today was 30 minutes tops. The majority of the workers kept the coasters moving quickly, resulting in the line moving quickly. \n\nMy favorite coaster was Cheetah Hunt! In my opinion, it had the most twists & turns & drops & just seemed like the longest! I loved it! \n\nOverall, I give the park a 4/5 since I got in cheaply, however if I were to pay the park price, I probably would rate it a 3/5.",

One of our family members is disabled & had crutches so we signed up for the program that helps cut wait time.... it was ridiculous. We literally had to check in at every ride just to be told to come back later to ride without the wait.... which required more walking (including my pregnant cousin) we ended up splitting up just to accomplish this efficiently.

I researched it online and I was super excited to see all the haunted houses, there were like 10 advertised. When we got there, we quickly found out that there were NO haunted houses, and that most of the rides were closed.  I know Busch gardens will say they disclosed this on the website, but I visited the website a few times and it was not conspicuous at all. The place had \"scare zones\" which were basically a couple people dressed up hiding in bushes along the pathway. The food options were also closed. As a first impression, this place was terrible! Our entire group of four was so disappointed, we wanted to leave after 20 minutes.  During this pandemic, people are savoring their social experiences and really expect to at least get their money's worth. Busch Gardens is welcome to reach out to me for info regarding a refund.",

Wait times for rides are very long. The cost of a speed pass nearly doubles the cost of a ticket and you still have to wait on line. There are no single rider lines like a lot of other parks and everything is super expensive. Good choices are limited to greasy burgers and deep fried crap...nothing good!

      "text": "Came here for the 1st time ever on New Years Eve with the wife and child(4 yr old girl). We thought it was really cool to combine a zoo & theme park, as we've never been to or seen anything like it. So as not to restate what the previous 200+ reviews have said, I'll simply list the highlights and what we liked.\n\n1. Having a four year old is tough at some parks because they're usually too small for everything. We loved the Sesame Street area because it was just her size and there was plenty to do. This is where we spent a lot of our day. There were a few other rides in a couple of other places in the park for the 42in & under visitors as well.\n\n2. You're closer to the animals here than I've ever been at ANY zoo(to include San Diego). The tigers(white & regular) came up to the glass and stared down the guests, and they also paced back & forth right in front of the nets outside(I could hear their breathing and footsteps). I also liked the little space where you climbed up the ladder into the glass box that they were sitting on and around. We also saw the giraffes and elephants too, but missed the other creatures(lions, gorillas, etc) because we didn't think to go see them before it got dark. The safari train during the day probably would have been cooler than when we went at night(we saw nothing).\n\n3. The food at the BBQ place(Zambia Smokehouse) was GOOD! I actually wrote a separate review on that page for it. The short version is lots of food & delicious!\n\nWe didn't ride any of the coasters, but ended up spending a full day between shows(the Madagascar one is HILARIOUS!!) and the rides for the little one. We also got a caricature drawing and saw part of the band performance featuring LSU & Iowa. And did I mention this was all free(for military with dependents once per year)! We are actually looking at getting annual passes here, because I can think of way worse ways to spend a Saturday. If you've never been here, you've got to check this place out at least once.",

They closed the rides in the back of the park to push you to the front and push you out! Then the lines at the rides at the front were very long. You should state that the park is open until 10 but rides stop at 8! They closed all of the rides except 2 and didn't tell anyone so you wasted your time walking to them.",

Her neck was injured and 8 months later she still has on an off pain. The second time she was injured was on the Blimpy Water Ride. This ride has no safety belt and I was sitting behind her. When it came down the water drop, I was pushed on her and she hurt her adult front tooth by hitting it on the seat in front of her.  Her tooth was moved to the front. I decided to report the incident this time. I should have reported the first incident on the Scorpion as well.  I told the risk management that these rides should be shut down due to not being safe, specially for the small kids. They only said if her permanent tooth needs work they will pay for it. That is all. I never heard back with a follow up even though the incident was reported to their risk control department. She has pain eating hard food now and the Dentist told us she might lose her otherwise healthy front tooth one they down the road.  I no longer trust Busch Garden and refuse to take my daughter on the old rides. I came to the conclusion that this company is greedy and only cares about making profits.",

I went to one store to return it and they said they needed their Supervisor to complete the transaction and that I would have to go to the other half of the park to find him. We had to leave around that time so we tried another store and they called the supervisor to come to us which was very sweet cause the other store told us to go to him when we didn't have time to.

That's what you come to Busch Gardens for, the insane looping, twisting turning, gut-wrenching speed demons. \n\nFirst and foremost:\nCheetah Hunt! Cheetah Hunt! Cheetah Hunt! This is the BEST roller coaster in the park! Honestly, it's one of the Top 3 coasters I've ever ridden, and that includes ones in Six Flags. I've come to this park 4 times now, and the previous 3, I never saw Cheetah Hunt. So I did a search and saw it opened in 2011, 1 year after my last time here. Well, it was a pleasant surprise and lived up to its name...Cheetah. This is a FAST ride. But it doesn't just have one speed, it literally goes from fast to faster. It reminded me of those Mario Kart games where when you rode through the mystery box and got the speed boost. My girlfriend and I got off the ride, and just kept looking at each other for 5 mins asking \"What just happened?\". I never had a roller coaster shake me up, but I definitely felt my nerves, in a good way, after coming off.\n\nIt's funny seeing how age and time have changed me. When I came here in high school, Kumba and Montu were everything to me. But after riding them this time (which I did after Cheetah Hunt), they didn't wow me like before. Sheikra still is very cool, it has 1 of the most intense drops you'll ever experience, but it's also the shortest ride you'll experience. If I had to stand on a long line for it, I'd be disappointed, but going on a Tuesday and getting on within 5 mins, was so worth it and the ride was short but sweet!\n\nBusch Gardens' jungle vibe is cool and exotic, and the rides are all designed appropriately to the park's theme. Being part zoo adds some extra fun, and I think I'll be really excited to return with my kids one day for these reasons. The train and sky ride are also great alternatives for when you get tired of walking. All in all, Busch Gardens is one of the many great parks we have here in Florida!",

      "text": "My party and I parked on the far end by the water park. The water park is closed until next season but there's a trolly that transports people go the main gate. Parking is $25 dollars all day no in and out. We had passes which were quickly scanned. There is a rental center where you can rent manual and electric wheels chairs, strollers, for a discount if you are a pass holder otherwise it's about $5-$10 more. The first ride called Montu was not memorable. We took a train which took us through small fields of animals. The different areas were labeled referencing different countries. We visited animals in Nairobi then got off near the rides. the second called Sheirka was exciting and has two steep drops that I wasn't ready for lol. The Tiger ride was super fast and exhilarating while upside down. The final ride that I visited was the free fall. This was my all time favorite. The thrill of dangling in the sky and just falling left me shook for five minutes and the wait was only 30 minutes as opposed to the two hour wait for the others. Word of advice COME EARLY or pay the extra money for the skip line. Do not eat at the food court. I ordered chicken strips and fries. The fries were cold , the strips weren't even chicken and the drink was watered down. Other than that the park was great.",

      "text": "Tampa's African Safari amusement park! Whenever I've came to Busch Gardens, it's mainly to see the animals. I would go as far as to say that they're not known for their rides. Don't get me wrong, they have some pretty fun rollercoasters, such as the Sheikra( My favorite) and Montu, but the main attraction are all the animal exhibits and tours. \n\nWe decided to go on the Serengeti Safari Tour! Whew I had a BLAST. We saw all types of animals, but being as giraffes are one of my favorite animals, I jumped at the chance to feed one. They were so calm and sweet.  I honestly don't think they gave a damn about us being there, they were more so interested in the wedges of lettuce the Safari Instructor handed to us to feed them. They also had a cameraman on our truck to take out photos which were available for ridiculously high prices after the tour. \n\nOne thing I will say is that although I always have a blast here, it sure will cost you a pretty for just about everything. In my opinion, the only way to make Busch Gardens worth it is to buy the a citypass and visit multiple places in addition to Busch gardens because it costs most as much to get into the park. \n\nAlso the tours can really add up in price as the safari tour was an extra $40 per person and you had to reserve your seats days in advance! \n\nSeems like I'm talking about money a lot but I just wouldn't want anyone to come here expecting a deal on anything haha. Otherwise it's fun for just about anyone regardless of age. I'd definitely come back if I were to visit Tampa again!",

Looking forward to attending one of the Hallow Scream events one of these years.....\n\nThe animals are nice, but you come here for roller coasters.\n\nMontu - Probably one of my favorite coasters - of all time. Feet dangling, couple inversions - great ride. My wife actually went on it twice, and I think this is the coaster that got her to like (read: tolerate) coasters. I remember me and a buddy got to go on it like 8 times straight, front row back at a field trip in high school.\n\nSheikra - I'll admit I am scared of heights and this one goes high, but the biggest shock is the 90 degree (or nearly 90) drop down. That little pause at the top, then the drop. I hate it in a: man, I love it kinda way.\n\nKumba - My favorite....when I was in 5th grade. The old timer is still doing good and is still super fast even in today's \"super coaster\" world. Fond memories of Kumba.\n\nGwazi - The only wooden coaster in the park will do a number on your neck as it whips your head back and fourth faster than Willow Smith.\n\nHaven't done cheetah yet, but I will next time.\n\nThen there's the non-coasters that really round it out:\n\nCongo River Rapids - Will leave you SOAKED! Make sure you have a change of clothes, or don't mind being dripping wet after riding this one.\n\nTidal Wave - So much fun here as a kid. We literally stood on the bridge for an hour, getting wave after wave to the face. Skip the ride, enjoy the bridge - especially for the kiddies.\n\nRhino Rally - A little boring, but still able to get somewhat close to some animals. It's worth it if there isn't a long wait.",

      "text": "I must say this experience today at your park was awful. I have been a pass holder for years and today makes me want to cancel and share just how awful this park is being ran. First, your website in purchasing tickets under my pass with 50% off didn't work so we purchased them under my partners. I called and spoke to customer service who said we needed to speak to customer service when we got to the park, and that she would note the account so they know that we did call them. She made reservations but we never received the email. We also purchased all day dining for most of our party. We got to the park and went to customer service only to be told there is nothing they can do but my 50% off tickets are there to be used at another time. We waited 50 min for food at the cafe by the front of the line because they had one side open. No soda, beer, bbq sauce. We purchased front of the line passes for 8 of us at that point due to lines. So you know we have spent a lot of money at this park! We tried eating at the smokehouse around 435 only to be turned away saying they closed at 430...even though the park closes at 6. We walked to the front of the park to ride cobras curse one last time. I tried getting a beer only to be told they close at 5 but there is another stand up front open. We walked up front as some of our party rode the ride and waited 10 min in line. Finally at the register at 535, we are told beer sales stop at 530. This entire experience was awful and would love for something to be done to show appreciation for our loyalty and wasted money today at the park.",

They also offer a free \"preschool\" Card for children ages 3-5. I would also recommend that one adult in your party upgrades from the fun pass to an annual pass as the annual pass will save you money! The annual pass offers free parking as well as a 20% discount on food and gift shops in the park. \nMy favorite place to eat is at the Zambia Smoke house in Stanley Ville. It has the best pulled pork and coleslaw!! It is also very close to Sesame Street safari play area where we spend most of our time. This play area has tons to do, plenty of kids rides and a large rope bridge style jungle gym for the kids to climb over the entire area! \nJungala is another fun area for kids as it has a tree top area for kids to explore as well as 2 splash pads (there is one splash area in Sesame Street play area as well). So it's a good idea to bring bathing suits even if your kids are too small for water rides.\nSince this place is half theme park and half zoo we like to spend half our time in Africa!! This is where you can go to see the lions, elephants and hyenas! My favorite animal to visit is the hippopotamus!! This hippopotamus area is the best I have ever seen as it has both an above Water exhibit and an aquarium style area where you can see the hippopotamus swim with the fish and ducks! \nWe come here very frequently, especially during the weekdays when there are less crowds! They have many events through the year with live music and fancy food pairings that can't be missed! Oh and try the fudge at sultans sweets it's amazing!!",

I don't even think we managed to get through the entire park. It was hot and honestly after we did all the kiddie rides we left. We were original suppose to go on a Saturday but it rained so they allowed my mom to move the tickets to Sunday. I will say they provide good customer service. However, their kiddie section wasn't that big and some of the rides were down. I understand some of the rides being down but the majority of them should be working of you charging people regular price. I feel if so many aren't working on a particular day, the price should be reduced for that day because essentially what are people paying for? The rides that the kids did get to ride they enjoyed. My youngest was too short to ride some of the rides but overall the girls had a blast! After so long, I think they were hot and we were all ready to go. Busch Gardens is a pretty big park. Like most amusement parks, be prepared to walk. The only other thing I did not like was the rides seemed so spaced apart. I know this may sound weird because you're thinking rides and they are huge, but something about the distance 3 rides took up/covered seemed off. Overall, it's a typical amusement park. I don't think it's anything special, but you can certainly have fun!",

Only a couple kiddie rides were going and not all of those, so even the little ones lost out. An extremely expensive day to walk around in the heat and be disappointed and see some animals and birds. Love the flamingos.  So call first to not waste your money.",

This is the only reason they are getting three stars and the only reason I would come back. BUT the park seemed dirty, the staff were mediocre and nothing sparked any joy other then the coasters. We had 2 kids under ten and most all the kids rides were shut down. This park could turn things around by training your staff to make a more memorable experience for their guest.

Be sure to take advantage of the b1 get 1 free alcohol with your dining pass. Lines can be very long for food and displayed ride wait times are sometimes way off. We are looking at you Cheetah coaster!!! All and all a good visit with a few just okay things. No intermittent rides for non coaster fans and food quality at some outlets really needs some improvement.

The whole park is awesome, the rides are awesome, and the animals are beyond beautiful. Someday I really want to do the Safari with my family to get a backstage view of the animal side and all that happens to take care of and preserve the wildlife. \nBG is doing their best to protect their patrons from CV-19, from requiring masks throughout the park, to social distancing, and to sanitizing the rides. But, this also cuts down on the time you can enjoy the park. On this day, Saturday, we were only able to enjoy two rides due to the extremely long wait. If you really want to enjoy riding as much as you can I would purchase the fast pass for $20. If not, you will be waiting 1.5 to 2 hours for one ride and currently the park hours are only 8 hours. Eating, walking between rides and attractions, and waiting in lines your time for enjoying rides is extremely prohibited. But, BG is doing the best they can and you need to plan accordingly. \nThank you again BG for your attentiveness and safety measures but more importantly for your appreciation for veterans and our families.",

When you are walking towards the temperature screening everyone is just on top of everyone literally on your back once again no employees to direct the crowd, but Busch garden WOW ! Horrible! The marking on the floor 6 feet apart do not matter In line they might but like 5 people in between those lines. I did not feel save. Barely any employees it was a total mess. People skipping lines and employees just turn there heads. I big portion of the employees have a negative attitude like they don't want to be there and help they look at you with a face it's suppose to be fun and when you go to amusement parks and the employees just give you a face and don't greet you it will automatically give a bad expression of the park they represent the park. Not sure I will visit again it was so packed I got there at 10:30am and left at 7pm and got on 2 rides. Busch gardens that's why you can compare to Disney not even close because you don't run your company well. Island and universal does a better job.",

      "text": "As a longtime resident of central Florida I've been to Busch Gardens a lot over the years and it has changed a great deal since my first visit. We became annual passholders a few years ago because of the Sesame Street offerings at Sea World and Bush Gardens.  \nMy child loves the Sesame Street Safari of Fun.  There are tons of rides for him to enjoy.  One of his favorites is the swings and he has been riding them by himself since he was 15 months old.  Next to them is a Bird Egg ride which we can ride together.  They also have a \"Dumbo\" style ride with Snuffy, the cutest little log flume, a carousel, Count's cars, and a kiddie roller coaster.  Plus, they do a show and story time in the Sesame Street theatre and there is  a large splash pad.  Seriously, I can and have just come with my kid to this area for 2-3 hours and then we leave because he is wiped out.  \nThe cool part is that there other rides for little ones elsewhere in the park too.  Near Falcon's Fury you can find a train, motorcycles, airplanes, and another carousel for the little ones.  We usually take the train to this part of the park and that adds yet another thing my child loves because not only does he get to ride the train, but also look at the animals.  \nFor those who like thrill rides Bush Gardens has some of the best.  Sheikra is one of my favorite roller coasters anywhere.  That 90 degree drop is amazing.  I'm also a huge fan of the Cheetah Hunt roller coaster.  My favorite ride though is probably Falcon's Fury.  It's just a straight drop while looking at the ground.  Talk about getting your adrenaline pumping!\nFood is your average theme park food and as such prices are pretty high for what you get.  I particularly like the place near Falcon's Fury because it's food court style so there are at least a good variety of options.  \nOccasionally, they do special dining events.  My son and I did a Sesame Street breakfast around Christmas 2019 and we loved it.  \nThey also hold some great festivals like their Food and Wine Festival and Mardi Gras Festival which bring in some pretty cool concerts and musical artists.  \nThe only real downside of Busch Gardens for me is the layout.  It is essentially a big circle.  Maybe this layout is because of the animals, which is fair, but it does lead to some issues in the park.  I was at the park with friends and we were going to see a concert as part of the Food and Wine Festival.  We were at the wrong end of the park and there wasn't an easy way to back to the Festival area so we missed the first couple minutes of the show.  Secondly, when visiting with a little one it's a long way between the Safari of Fun and the area with the other kid rides.  If we do both we basically end up walking the entire park which a toddler/preschooler can't really handle.  So, if I push to do both it usually ends in meltdown, so I usually have to make a choice between the two.  \nWe love Busch Gardens and will continue to enjoy our passes.",

I have seen a steady decline in the park since Anheuser Bush sold their business and sold the parks to another company as well. First thing was many of the attractions in the park were still closed, I understand this because of Covid, but all the large food vendors and   stores were open....then the worst part was the food, this had to be the worst dinning experience I have ever had, there is park food and then there is just terrible, this fell into the later category, the only thing that was not terrible were the fries, but come on, people are paying a lot of money for this, at least make an effort to make the food edible , but that was not the case....then there was the park, it was dirty and is beginning to look run down, few years back this was not the case, it (the park) is just not what it once was, defiantly second rate at this point....the rides are great as to be expected and I am guessing that this is what they are banking on, but the older I get the less I am riding the coasters, anyway, at the current decline rate of this park and the increasing cost to visit I can't see this place doing well...",

      "text": "While I love the rides at Busch Gardens and my boys and I did manage to have a fun-filled day of thrill rides, the COVID safety and enforcement of the park leaves a lot to be desired. While the lines were clearly marked and had people followed the \"wait here\" marks, people would have been staggered throughout the lines and social distancing would have been followed effectively. While I know that Busch Gardens cannot be held entirely responsible for the carelessness of its visitors, there was zero enforcement of rules while people waited in line. Only Falcon's Fury repeatedly announced the mask policy and made an attempt to space people the best they could. Other rides were just a cluster. People were too close - many didn't wear their masks (at all or properly covering their noses). I honestly only felt remotely OK because I paid $99 per person for the quick queue unlimited; waiting two hours in the conditions we saw would have been unbearable. And on some rides, rows were skipped and people were space nicely...while others had row after row of people and not any additional spacing between rows. Additionally, many of the sanitizer stations were empty and I questioned what was in the ones that were filled - as they were very thin and runny. I'd definitely recommend bringing your own sanitizer and lowering your expectations for a COVID safe experience. Overall, we had fun thanks to premium pricing but I was still disappointed with the level of enforcement, which made for an oftentimes stressful experience. Great rides, though, and we'll be happy to come back post COVID!",

It started with a group of 10 or so kids blatantly cutting from the very beginning of the cheetah, walking all the way through as close to the front one at a time (to be sneaky like) and stop right in front of us. When we called them out on it they just waited the jumped over the rope later to cut This sort of thing happened all day. On another ride (Cobra's Curse) there were 3 groups of two that violently pushed their way to the front of Cobra's Curse. If you dare stop them, they're ready to throw down! When you let staff know, they don't acknowledge the issue. Why bother posting signs that patrons will be removed from the park for cutting off there's no follow through? These patrons know that won't happen! \n\nFood is overpriced and eh. No one, literally no one, hardly wears masks! And it's no longer enforced. If that bothers you, stay home. People are up in your bubble in line. Social distancing is a thing of the past. At Busch Gardens, covid no longer exists! It appears they're open at full capacity as the parking lot was nearly entirely full when we arrived at noon. \n\nLines are over an hour long in most cases and the park is only open from 8-10. You can purchase passes $30 per person per ride (essentially a fastpass) but even those lines aren't super quick. For that price I better get right on!\n\nThere's hardly any quiet spaces to sit and people watch, or just relax. \n\nThe tables are gross and filthy. Cleaning seems to have stopped as well. \n\nBusch Gardens, you REALLY need to up your game! Yuck! Not worth the money!",

We did not get there right at the beginning so as we were walking around a lot of booths were already out of what we wanted.

We had a bit of a wait for each ride but that was expected. If you're Looking to get on quick buy the quick que to cut the line. Most rides were open. However a lot of stores were closed and some rides too. We were a bit upset with lunch. We dined at the dragon or whatever it's called. I waited at the table while my husband took the kids to get the food. When he came back he said they made us throw away food we wanted. The cashier had said they could only get one side with a meal. He said ok I'll pay for the rest separate and she said no that he could only purchase the meal. No one or no sign said that before getting the food. He said ok well just go out it back. She said no it had to be thrown away! There was already a trash can full of uneaten food. What a waste!!!! I can't believe how much money and food just thrown away. The tables were cleaned as soon as people got up from the table. So bravo on keeping clean. They were pretty good with making sure people followed the mask rules. They also weren't super strict about it either. Other than the food waste, we had a good time don't know if we'll be back as we are from out of town but I hope they can open up more and fix the dining situation. I'm very happy that we were able to enjoy ourselves for free. The military family's really love this and appreciate it very much.

That's Falcons fury! must-rides.\n\nWhether you're 7 or 97 they have something for you! The zoo, fun rides, and shows - my favorite show is Opening night critters, the animals' performance is mind-blowing! There are a couple of rides where you can get wet but you'll be fine with breathable fast drying clothes or bring a waterproof jacket or poncho if you want to remain completely dry. \n\nThere is a splash area for kids and an area under one of the rides that splashes water that a lot of people like to go to, you could take a bathing suit for that if you'd like. Also, you can rent a locker that's transferrable throughout the park, and there are lockers by most rides. \n\nThere is (theme park priced) food and ice cream around the park. As well as some other things like face painting and caricaturing. You can feed animals like birds and kangaroos, and go on sort of a safari with the train. \n\nThey also have fun events, like summer nights going on right now; they close late, have special summer menus, and end the nights with fireworks. The ticket prices are great, especially if you buy an annual pass, you get Busch Gardens, Adventure Island, parking and discounts included. \n\nRegular parking is far no matter how early you go; you would have to take the tram. If you have If you have babies/ strollers, you should be able to park close to the entrance. It can get crowded but it's usually less crowded during the week. Be sure to check the weather too as you usually can't go on rides when theres thunder close by. \n\nAll in all, best theme park in Tampa!",

It's all the fun without the long waits or rude staff members. Every employee always has a smile and is extremely helpful. You would genuinely have no idea that you were in the heart of Tampa because of the atmosphere. Parking was a breeze and the dining was incredible! Busch Gardens is a MUST every holiday season! Howloscream was so much fun and their Christmas attraction is beautifully set up - great for pictures!\nWe waited in maybe one, five minute line, but that was the extent of our time in lines, the rest was quick and exciting! Honestly, don't waste your money on a fast pass here. The lines are short enough as it is.\nSTUDENTS: get your pass at the park for cheap and go all year long! My friends and I go for a few hours after classes and it's empty! I definitely recommend it!",

So unless you are tolerable with the heat, humidity, mask combo I don't recommend. A lot of rides were closed, the main playgrounds for kids were closed. A lot of the smaller beverage and food places were closed. A lot of side vendors like face painting were closed. Parking is $25 and it seems as though that is always rising. Some pulled brisket and overcooked waffle fries was $19??? Lol. \n\nJust save your money and go elsewhere- no matter how \"good\" the deal might be advertised.

      "text": "Hands down, one of my favorite theme parks. I feel like there's a lot for everyone to do, since it's part thrill rides, part zoo. Fave coasters include Cheetah Hunt, Sheikra and Montu. I love that in the middle of a hot day you can also jump on a train and travel through the Serengheti Plains and see loads of animals, big and small. It's a nice little break in the day and always cool to have zebras walking alongside you.\n\nAs with most theme parks, food prices are steep. But, one of the things BG does have working for it is that some of the food is actually good. The BBQ place by Sheikra is good. Smoked meats, lots of variety and good side dishes. Also, the Colonial House over by Cheetah Hunt is a fave of mine when I want sit down service. You're in the A/C, overlooking the animals, and get decent food. Can't go wrong.\n\nThe shows at BG are also nice. Right now in the Moroccan Theater they have an ice skating show. Talented performers and it's fun to watch. Also, I forget the name of it, but in Pantopia there the animal show, with LOADS of animals that do tricks (dogs, cats, birds, horse, more birds, pigs, more birds, and even a mouse). My 7 year old LOVES this. Belly busting laughs!!\n\nRegarding service in BG, everyone's friendly. The couple of times I've gone in the last year I've noticed they seem short staffed in some areas. For example they used to have people stationed periodically throughout long lines. They don't anymore, and the last few times I've seen a lot of line jumpers, and no one around to do anything about it :( Also, it's a bummer when you go on a weekday and not all the food stations are open. I get it, if it's not populated, why have the extra workers. BUT from the customer perspective, it stinks when half the food carts or locations are closed.\n\nIf you're local, it's a better deal to get the Annual Pass. Between the monthly offers and free parking, it pays itself off very quickly!",

      "text": "I've been coming to Busch Gardens for over 20 years. Since the days Anheuser-Busch had a stable for the Budweiser Clydesdale horses and a brewery on site that provided two free samples of beer. I was here when they featured a lonely albino alligator and when the shows were more impressive than the rides. I've seen rides come and go and have done everything there is to do and rode everything there is to ride. Yet I'm always excited to return. I came so often at one point that we were season pass holders living in a different state!\n\nWhy? Busch Gardens to me feels like going to a really awesome public park. I know it's a theme park, but it feels like a festival. The combination of theme park, water park, landscaped gardens and zoo with a variety of theatrical shows thrown into the mix give me that childhood comfort of spending the day at jazz festivals with my family. Honestly, if I never rode one ride the entire day I'd be okay with it. I just like being here.\n\n\nTHINGS TO DO\n\nI love the excitement of watching my tween children rush to be the first on a new attraction, like Cheetah Hunt, which is now in my top 10 list of favorite coasters. I love that my grandson finds joy in the toddler-friendly play areas and experiences awe and wonder in the bird sanctuary where beautiful lorikeets hang out on your finger as you feed them nectar. I adore the talent of the performers in the ice show and quality of the animal shows. As a matter of fact, animals ARE the show!\n\nEverywhere you turn animals are on display. Giant tortoises, lazy Florida gators, cheetahs, elephants, playful orangutans opening their Christmas presents and white tigers who seem more comfortable in water than on land. You can feed kangaroos, sloths, lemurs, and experience the animals of Africa and Australia up close.\n\n\nTHE RIDES\n\nMy top favorite rides are:\n1) Cheetah Hunt\n2) Sheekra\n3) Falcon's Fury\n4) Kumba\n5) Serengeti Railway\n\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nBusch Gardens and SeaWorld seem to put more effort into their food than many other theme parks, which makes for a nicer experience. Turkey Legs are still our families favorite treat. Just seems like they go with the entire theme park experience.\n\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nCombined with the Serengeti safari atmosphere, new coasters being added every year and awesome shows, Busch Gardens gives you an ever-changing good bang for your family buck! Get the multi-park pass to Seaworld for only $10 or so more for 2 days of great adventures.\n\n\n2016/52",

I was told by Gabby at Adventure Island that I could get my two park pass refunded however when I returned to Busch Gardens for the refund Marilyn who seemed to be the manager was rude and not very accommodating to my situation. The situation could have been handled better on the ground level and could have been avoided entirely without the expected shady business practices of Seaworld.\n\nAll in all, If you are dying to ride some rollercoasters it could be fun but unless eating an overpriced dogmeat hot dog and looking at depressed komodo dragons integrated with your rollercoaster experience is your thing go to the beach instead. Not returning.",

It's big, but not obscenely large and the rides are top notch especially if you like roller coasters and thrill rides. \n\nI love theme parks and I've wanted to go for years so now that I've finally gone I'd totally go back again. \n\nFor me the thing that stood out is how awesome the attractions were and the focus on the coasters was surely welcome, but the feeling that the modern conveniences and finishes that you tend to see at places like Universal or Disney were missing here. \n\nLockers for rides cost .50 per use as opposed to the electronic ones you can use at other parks for free. The bathrooms were dated and in need of updating as well. These aren't deal-breaker issues, but I'd like to see the addressed at some point.\n\nThe rides are AMAZING. The footprint of the park is such that they don't make you walk a ton from one attraction to another like other parks. You won't be exhausted the way you can be with a lot of negative spaces between rides, and therefore you can easily do the whole park in a day.",

I truly believe when you open your place of business it should be completely opened.  You get there the parking lot opens about 9:30am. You pay $28.00 U.S. or $14 if a pass holder. The ticket for 1 day at the gate is $109. So you go to stand in line to get in. At 10:00 am you go in the gates. Can you ride the rides, go to sesame street, or go see animals, no you cannot. You have to wait till 10:30am for some of the earlier attractions to open, even the concession stands aren't open. If you want to ride some of the rides, you have to wait till noon. Some places don't even open till a line forms and the attendant has to finish with another ride. This is Florida it's very hot and humid. If your handicapped and have a parking permit you can get kinda close to the gates sometimes. They are painting the parking lot which could be done at night. Be prepared to go a football field distance before you get to the only gates to enter. Your being robbed of so much when the WHOLE park isn't opened all the way.\nIf they treat paying customers this way, how are the animals and employees treated?\n Don't give a \"standard\" reply about contacting at an email or a premade answer, like you have done to so many before.

We were already disappointed when we arrived because we paid $25 for parking and they closed almost the whole lot so we had to drive around till someone left! When we got here we couldn't even find all the animals, the website is so deceiving they show 17 animals and all we saw was a flamingos, tiger and orangutan. And a whole lot of bird exhibits. We paid $90 a person and we didn't get to ride any rides or see hardly any animals, what a joke! Also there was no enforcing the Mandatory face coverings, hardly saw any employees except in the store or ride entrance but when it started to storm you couldn't find an employee anywhere. Please don't waste your money, we wish we would've just added another day to Disney World, Way More Fun and they enforce the mask rule! Sent in a complaint to at least get some money back for being such a disappointment, they replied back a month after I wrote it saying tickets are non refundable but we can go back??

Otherwise I would have spent $300 for single day passes. This place is huge, so one day won't be enough for first timers.\n\nBG Tampa is very large and hard to navigate. I literally had to ask for help to find my way out of certain areas. Things are not clearly marked. While we went a week before Christmas, this place was PACKED. I guess that's the bad thing about a Florida theme park, there's never an off season. \n\nBy far the best part of BG Tampa are the animals. You must take the train, as it winds it way through an open zoo without fences. BG does a better job with their african animals than Disney does with their Animal Kingdom safari.\n\nThe downside to BG Tampa are the rides that break down often. Cobra's Curse spent more time broken than actually running and my daughter never did get to ride it. The size of the park is too large to see in one day. BG Williamsburg is tiny in comparison. There was a lot I didn't see and wished I could, but the crowds dissuade me from ever returning.\n\nBG Tampa is well worth the visit, but plan on at least two days. Avoid going at christmas time and summertime, as the crowds and heat in Florida are beastly, respectively.",

      "text": "Less of a review of the park (or which would be a 4+ star mostly glowing review) and more about the parks handling of Covid safety procedures.\n\nThis was our sixth park in six days (Sea World Orlando & the four Disney parks preceded this one) and over 30 visits last year to my home park (Six Flags Great Adventure) and this was by far the most lax when it came to enforcing procedures. \n\nEarly in the day there were employees stationed in pathways directly reminding guests to wear masks properly but by 2pm there were none to be seen.\n\nThe absolute worst (trained or caring, not sure) was the Tigris crew. We were in line for over 35 minutes and it wasn't until we were in the station that any announcement was made reminding people of mask usage. More than a quarter of the line either had their mask under their nose, on their chin or completely off for almost the entire time in line, including when they were directed to rows and seated on the ride. One of the crew members had their mask under their nose and she was checking restraints. What's amazing is this was the only ride we encountered throughout the day that was disinfected while we were in line (though in hindsight, despite the announced delay, it could have been for cleaning for more a more common reason on a coaster), which made the lack of acknowledgement of guests incorrectly or not wearing masks surprising.\n\nFortunately, this issue wasn't encountered to this extent on other ride lines and most of the food locations were running well, with Zambia Smokehouse being the one exception due to staffing. To exit the food line to to cashier you had to navigate through the line entering the food line. Sea World solved this problem by having an employee hold guests at one part of the line to prevent crowding and that would have been a big improvement here.\n\nOne other major thing missing throughout the park was plexiglass between narrow switchbacks in lines that couldn't be spaced out. Most lines were moving fairly quickly, but the areas that couldn't be spaced out also tended to be the most congested. Another area that could be improved with better staffing.\n\nOverall, it's still a great park, but maybe not one you want to visit right away without a Covid vaccine.",

I'll start by laying out the time frame I went in, which was Spring Break.\n\n The lines were as expected, long but they moved at a good pace. The crowds wasn't to bothersome or unruly. Everyone wanted to get in the park, go get on rides and enjoy the many adventures Busch Gardens had to offer. \n\nI got in free on this occasion due to my job but if I had had to pay I would definitely be giving this review a star or two less. \n\nReason being, most of the food vendors either ran out of food, which we didn't find out until standing in line for 30 minutes or so. Or they didn't have enough staff to move the product efficiently. \n\nAnother thing that blew my mind was that it was spring break and as we got off one ride expecting to get on another roller-coaster ride. We find out that it's shut down. Okay...... on to the next. The next one was shut down too. Luckily they had little carnival style games to play while I figured out what course of action to take while I wait for one of the rides to open up. We ended up finding the more so kiddy roller-coaster rides, which finished up the day for me after about eight hours of standing up and walking around. \n\nI'm not sure if I would go back or not. I will say that I've been to a few parks that seemed a lot better up kept, better customer service and the rides kept going.",

      "text": "First of all, PLEASE please, ignore bad reviews!!  Busch Gardens is an amazing park.  Also remember that the animals came before the rides, so don't try to compare this to a regular theme park.  We first visited Busch Gardens 11 years ago, and hadn't visited since.  I was excited to see what's new.  We were really amazed with how themed and expansive the park had become.  Everything was clean and brightly colored.  The animal exhibits are incredible.  You get to be so close to so many amazing creatures.  Make sure you see the cheetah run while you're there, that was awesome!!  Man they're fast!!  I also highly recommend doing the add-on safari tour, where you'll get SUPER close to giraffes.  It was AMAZING!!!  It was like sensory overload, we felt like little kids again.  Also the giraffe bar was really nice!!  Great cocktails, with an amazing savannah view.  Make sure you feed the lorikeets.  Well worth the money!  They are so stinkin adorable.  My husband had 1 on his head, 1 on his shoulder and 1 on his arm.  They were licking his ear, pecking his hat, and trying to nibble his hair.  It was so funny and cute.  We love so much about this park.  As far as the rides go, I'm 38, my husband is 40...we don't really care for roller coasters much anymore.  I get headaches so going upside down has become a no no for me.  But the rides look really cool!!  We did go on a couple tamer ones, including the carousel, hahaha, and had fun.  So if you're 40+, you will definitely enjoy this park, even without the rides.  We also really enjoyed the train ride through the savannah, it offered views you can't see anywhere else in the park.  If you have food allergies like me, I recommend the smokehouse.  And if you want to save $$ on drinks, buy the refillable cup, it's free refills on the day you purchase it.  We had fun refilling at the create-your-own Coca Cola fountains.  I recommend 2 days in this park, even if you don't go on the roller coasters.  There's just so much to see, you don't want to rush it.  And wear good walking shoes!!  We walked about 14 miles the two days we were there.  Also do yourself a favor and purchase the preferred parking, it's definitely worth it. Save that walking for inside the park.  Now go get those Busch Gardens tickets!",

I paid $80 for a meal pass and all we got to eat was pizza and a disgusting cheese burger since the lines were ridiculous for everything. I wish I could get my $80 back since the food they provided us was not nutritious at all. Sweating and being dehydrated and then eating pizza and fries made me want to throw up. The meat in the burgers should not be allowed. I feel like I ate dog food.",

They were only open until 7pm sadly. \n\nWe did get to ride many of the rides but 6 hours doesn't give you enough time to make it through the park because the roller coaster lines are ridiculously long. \n\nI highly recommend paying the $12 to feed the kangaroos!

The summer nights are fun.  We actually had a tailgate party in the parking lot around dinner.  The kids went back in to ride one more coaster before it closed.  We sat and watched the fireworks from the parking lot as the kids made their way back to the car.  The getting in and out was relatively simple and non frustrating.  Except the $25 to pay for parking.  That isn't fun...but cheaper than Disney I think.  It clearly isn't Disney but man, not being in the mad chaos of Disney is super sweet too.  If your kids like coasters or if you do, this is a great place to go...lots of unique coasters I haven't ever seen before.  Well worth it in my book.",

They are requiring that you wear a mask at all times which is a major health issue. It was about 85\u00b0 the day we went and within a couple of hours our masks were completely wet. I know that a lot of the workers were pulling their mask down below their nose is as well and all were suffering equally.  The park had a number of rides that were not operating including the skyline, the iron kwanzi coaster, raft water ride, And none of the shows were open. The hours were 10 to 6 with most of the roller coasters not opening until 1030 or 11. If we did not have fast passes we probably would not have got to ride all the rides are would've spent the entire day standing in line to try to beat the 6 o'clock deadline.  We also noted that there were not very many food stands open along the way which caused us to have to find places to eat they were not convenient. We just did not feel like we had a fool amusement park experience and based on all the complicity we have seen on this park over the years it did not live up to our expectations.  I'm not sure we will be going back because I think our money would be better spent maybe at one of the Orlando theme parks.",

      "text": "First, it is obvious that this park lacks in reinvestment.  Many rides are not running at their optimal cycle times.  Rides were designed for 2 or 3 loading stations but they only run 1 or 2, respectively, increasing the ride wait times.  This is most likely due to lack of maintenance dollars to keep all stations running and cannibalizing parts or just shear unwillingness to staff the ride appropriately.  Another potential is that they are trying to drive add-on business by selling more quick queues.  \n\nRide wait times are very inaccurate never on the good side.  Cedar Fair, Disney and Universal do this much better.  \n\nI paid $200 for 2 quick queues and still struggled to have a great time not due to wait times obviously but mostly due to other reasons.  I am referencing wait times based on talks with people who did wait in line and asking them their wait experience.\n\nMany rides are dated in a bad way.  Not in a nostalgic wooden roller coaster way.  There are 4 that we really liked: chakeira, Tigris, cheetah hunt and Mantu.  These however fail to compare to the mega coaster era but are fun.  \n\nThe worst part, you buy a cup that is refillable but the stations to refill them are far and few between.  And once you get there, you have to wait in a 15 minute line to pay $1.00 for your refill.  Here is a pro tip, automate the coke freestyle machines and put them out more frequently.\n\nLocker rentals are $8 a day.  Ok, nickel and dime you but expected.  Food is terrible and expensive.  The pizza was the worst.  The BBQ is mediocre but extremely expensive.  $12 for a turkey leg is highway robbery.  \n\nIf the President of the company were to follow a day in the life of the average attendee, they would realize the folly of their business.  I will fly down and share the experience with the president, so that they can see how dismal it is at all their parks I visited: Busch Gardens, Sea World and Aquatica.  \n\nSea World was by far the worst experience, again even with quick queue.  The penguin ride was hotter than hades waiting in a tunnel of fake ice and no air movement.  At gardens, the cobras curse is a stroke away from a law suit.  No air movement, hotter inside than outside.  All to cut costs.  \n\nCut costs is all I saw at all three parks.  If that is the memory you want left in the mind of your visitors, well done... well done.",

The best two things about this park: the all-day-dining deal and the animals including the safari.  \nIf you are planning on going to Busch Gardens this summer, purchase the all-day-dining deal.  It's totally worth it and not only can you eat all you want all day long, you get 50% off of the outdoor vendor kiosks.  So a bottle of water for $1.25, not bad, huh?  The other thing I suggest is the quick queue unlimited or what I like to call: the skip the line pass.  This works on just about every ride and is only $55/person.  You just show the attendant your wrist band and you walk right up to the front of the line.  The most I waited all day was approx. 15 min. in the Montu line and this was b/c I wanted to sit in the front for this free form coaster.  Which, by the way, was sick!  If you are going to ride the Montu, sit in the front.  I also suggest sitting in the front for the Cheetah Hunt.  I sat in the middle the first time and then sat in the front the second time.  Have you ever had key lime pie from a diner and key lime pie from Key West?  If so, you know what I am talking about.  If not, your life is not yet complete and please  visit Key West immediately.  Now back to the quick queue...the pass pays for itself just by not waiting in the Cheetah Hunt line.  That line was almost an hour long and I walked right up and rode it both times waiting no more than 5 min. and that was to stil in the front.  Just buy the pass.  Enough said.\nAs for the animals and the safari, absolutely incredible.  My wife and I took part in the sunset safari which was phenomenal and the guide (Kelsey, I think) was so knowledgable and friendly.  You get to see the animals up close and personal not to mention you pretty much have a beer in your hand the entire time since you have to be 21 to book this safari and they give you 2-3 beers per person depending on if others want their beer, how many they bring, etc.  Just an incredibly fun experience and nothing like I have ever done before.\nAs for the rides, the Momtu was the best coaster and the rolling rapids was the best water ride.  For the rapids, remember to bring a bar of soap b/c you will get soaked so you might as well get clean all at the same time.\nIf you live in Florida and haven't been to this park yet, go now!  Spend a weekend in the Tampa area and experience all that Busch Gardens has to offer.  You won't be disappointed.",

A beer company that developed a legacy that is like an adult disney. But unfortunately with less beer now.\n\nThe park is a good size and divided into sections of countries. They have Africa, Egypt, Asia, Australia and much more! It is basically a zoo with crazy roller coasters everywhere! Animals from around the world and a lot to learn about them too. Then you get to go on all that nonsense and throw your brains up. I refused to get on about 70% of the stuff. It is way too intense for me. But to all you daredevils this is heaven for you!  I went at the perfect time where every wait time was only 5-10 minutes! My friend rode everything and i did not have to wait long at all! The Florida one-day pass was the same price as an annual pass so I may return later this year. Get a picture with Elmo, feed the Kangaroos, and scream your heads off!",

      "text": "Being born and raised in Florida I've never came to Busch Gardens before and it was until I saw their BOGO deal that it was a sign to finally visit. Tickets are usually $80 + tax. So the BOGO deal was definitely worth the price.I came on a Sunday morning at around 11am (park opens at 10) and parking was pretty busy especially since there is traffic coming from both sides of the street. After parking you can get on a tram to get to the front of the theme park. The park has a mixture of roller coasters, mini rides from younger children, and zoo spread out throughout the park. There are animals such as tigers, lions, cheetahs, orangutans, rhinos, penguins, and more! It's cool to walk from different roller coasters and see these animals casually living their lives. The rides had decent waiting times and you definitely get an adrenaline rush after riding them. \n\nOn this day, it did end up raining around 3pm that lasted 2 hours causing the rides to close down for safety reasons. My group was concerned because we came to Tampa for this one day and it was being wasted by the rain, but! We were in line for guest relations and BG has a rain policy which meant they gave us tickets that we can use on another day!! I can't wait to go back to ride the coasters that I didn't get to go on due to the rain n",

A Tampa Bay classic attraction, tons of exotic animals to see and interact with, great roller coaster rides and (before COVID/hopefully soon), great shows to see! The park is massive so download the app on your phone prior to your visit as they currently aren't giving out paper versions. This is an all day attraction so come when they open if you want to do everything and beat the crowds. I recommend doing at least one of the VIP animal experiences as well - the kangaroo one was really cool, will be returning and hopefully doing the Hippo one next!",

      "text": "I should have read the reviews before going but I had been to busch gardens Tampa a few years ago and it was amazing. I guess they're trying to make back their revenue losses from covid... \n\n$100 a ticket, paid $45 for preferred parking online only to arrive and be told that parking was full and i'd have to go get a refund. Why would they keep selling preferred parking when they knew it was full? Plus once in the park they didn't even give me a refund, but a $20 park credit which I ended up spending on ONE (1) nasty hotdog and some bottles of water. If they actually cared about customers they'd have water bottle filling stations. The only other food I purchased was 4 chicken tenders and cold fries costing $15. \n\nHere's the kicker: The entire day, never stepped foot on a ride. Some rides had over two hour waits and all others were shut down. On top of that, now you have to PAY to leave your belongings in a locker in order to get on any ride, either $8 for the whole day or $2 a ride I think. It's a small thing but it really made me feel that the park was trying to squeeze out every penny they could. Even the sky ride was closed. I wouldn't be upset if I knew any of this beforehand. Also, bird exhibit where the birds come and land on you: gone. \n\nThe day was spent walking around sweating our butts off looking for literally anything to do. \nSuch a huge waste of so much money and the day.",

      "text": "I have been to Busch Gardens quite a few times, however this past weekend was the first time I decided to suck it up and brave the roller coasters. My partner in crime is a coaster fanatic, while I am unfortunately very susceptible to motion sickness. So I armed myself with Sea Bands, non-drowsy Dramamine and lots of courage and decided that I was not going to get sick.  For roller coaster enthusiasts, Busch Gardens is hands down the best amusement park in the Central Florida area. No other park, not even Islands of Adventure, can top the sheer amount of coasters Busch has. \n\nWith that said, this weekend was either a really bad weekend for Busch or the economy is getting to their maintenance team. The brand new coaster, Cheetah, was malfunctioning half the day, as were Montu (we couldn't even ride it, it was always broken) and several of the other coasters were having issues. We arrived promptly at 8:30 AM (the park opened at 9:30 AM) expecting to beat the crowds to the rides, heading straight for Cheetah as soon as the doors were opened (which, by the way, they don't do until exactly on time...more on this later). Cheetah was not working from the beginning, we waited an hour at the front of the line, which hundreds lined up behind us, waiting for them to fix it. We finally did, and it was worth every second of wait. Me, the anti-coaster half of our team, was smiling and loving every second of the ride. I did end up feeling dizzy after, but Cheetah really is smooth and enjoyable. Plus it is LLLOOOONNNNGGG! If you look at the map, Cheetah snakes through almost a quarter of the park. \n\nThe other coasters were a little too rough for me, especially the wooden coaster, Sheikra. That one was the beginning of the end for me. If there is one thing I learned from our day, it is that no amount of Sea Bands and Dramamine can keep away motion sickness when you're being jostled around at insane speeds. But I maintain that Cheetah is a great ride for just about everyone. \n\n#1 Tip: Arrive early, really early...like an hour before the park opens. You will have to wait the entire hour, but you'll be in front of all the other people waiting much farther behind you. The parking lot doesn't open until 30 minutes before park opening, but a line of cars forms in front of the entrance. We had a lot of fun people and car watching while waiting. And we got an amazing parking spot. \n\n#2 Tip: Print your tickets at home. Make sure you have a clear barcode to scan at the self-service turnstiles and you'll easily get your tickets and get into the park as quickly as possible. The turnstiles open early, they just rope off the actual front of the park until opening time. Make sure to get a little pushy and get as far front as possible. Have a gameplan in place and go directly to your #1 attraction, especially if choosing one of the newer coasters. 20 minutes after park opening and Cheetah already had a two hour wait. \n\n#3 Tip: If you have the extra money, the passes that allow you to skip the line are absolutely worth it. Instead of a 2 hour wait, you'll have maybe a 15-20 minute wait. \n\n#4 Tip: The Zambia Smokehouse has the best smoked chicken and macaroni n'cheese I've had in a very long time. Delicious.",

No rides and wanted food but after the line moving only about 3 feet in 1 hour (thanks to people giving up and walking away) at the zagoria (?) I decided to go hungry as to not make children suffer any longer than necessary. Saw gorillas, went to the train and was told there would be an hour wait. Went home. Spoke with dozens of other in my many hours of waiting. Not one person was happy about the experience. And many had young crying children. Literally child abuse as there were children and adults sleeping on benches. These poor parentss could have taken their children to the beach or a park for free. Instead a family of four could easily be out $800.00 and received nothing in return. Busch gardens stole a lot of money and a Saturday from me and thousands of others. I was robbed and the fun pass useless because I will never ever return. I considered calling and demanding a refund. But he the truth is I'll probably have to wait hrs for a manager.  So ill have to accept defeat knowing I was scammed and can't do anything about it. A very well or orchestrated SCAM. Please don't waist your time and hard earned money!!! BTW no shows same outrageous price. 1st safty measure was herding humans into a very crowded tent for a tempature check with NO social distancing at all. Neither the mask or social distancing policy's were being endorced at all. The only time a made it thru a line was where they had drinks, turkey legs, popcorn. One employee LONG line.

Regardless of the cooler weather, we dressed appropriately and knew that the park would have fewer people, as students were back in school and the weather was not the best.  We were correct. However, rides were not opened throughout the day. They opened for brief periods of time and we were told due to \"technical\" reasons. It happened on at least 7 adult rides (not including water rides or children's). This forced long lineups on a day where there should have been literally no wait time. Some of us waited two hours for the Cheetah Run, when it actually opened.  The decision to open and close rides was done, in our opinion, due to staffing and fiscal reasons - NOT what was best for the customer.

      "text": "Beware of Bad weather at Busch Gardens!!!!\n\nI  went to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay on August 2nd with my husband and 4 teenagers, who were excited to experience the roller coasters.  We arrived shortly after the park opened and it rained intermittently in the morning.  Not a single ride was operating during this time.  We purchased drink bottles and ate lunch believing a ride would open at some point (because according to the app, the rides were open and had short wait times).  Eventually we heard the sound of a roller coaster being tested, so we got on line.  It sounded like a stampede of excited park goers racing toward the lines.  Suddenly, a storm began & the ride never actually boarded passengers.  At 5:30, we finally gave up & got on the guest services line to attempt to get a refund, but the customer service supervisor, Heather, was rude and condescending and did not care that we spent over $500 to NOT RIDE A SINGLE RIDE.  She said since our tickets were scanned, all she could offer was a rainy day return ticket.  I inquired as to why they wouldn't warn people that no rides were operable & explained that we felt we had been scammed.  She was completely unsympathetic.  Additionally, she said since we bought tickets from AAA...(gasp, the horror...a 3rd party....) we would need to take our issues up with them.  How would AAA know how bad our experience was at the park?  Anyone could call & claim that something went wrong on their visit.  If you accept a ticket & the name of your organization is on a ticket, you should be responsible for dissatisfied customers at your own park.  I've been to many Six Flags parks, Disney & Universal and NEVER experienced anything like this.  I'm very angry because my husband and I work hard for our money and did not deserve to be treated this way and conned out of $500.  We wasted a whole day of our vacation being miserable at your park and then we were mistreated by customer service.",

I grew up in theme parks basically so I know a good one...they are taking great safety precautions after covid opening and I feel very safe there! \n\nThe staff is so welcoming and friendly, the rides are top notch (but #MontuisBoss) and I love visiting all the beautiful animals! This place literally changed my life and got me out of a very bad spot. I will always love you Busch Gardens. I even turned down a job out of state just bc I still want you in my life lol crazy, maybe, but I listened to my intuition & my heart. Every day there is always better than the last...why would I ever want to give that up!?",

      "text": "Although the concept is very intriguing and the pricing is fair, the fact that none of the roller coasters worked was a huge bummer. We were sitting waiting for Sheikra for about a half an hour (which isn't horrible) the coaster broke down, we thought okay. Stuff happens. About 30 minutes later it was back up and running. Then, we went to Falcon's Fury and that coaster broke down. We asked for a Supervisor and Brandon the Supervisor came over and was helpful. Allowed us to go first once Falcon Fury was fixed plus he gave us a pass for another coaster (Tigris). We were okay with this, however, when we got to Tigris that coaster was now broken. We have now spent over half of our day just trying to get on a roller coaster. The Supervisor on that ride (Cassie) was absolutely fantastic and gave us a couple of passes for Quick Queue. We really appreciated that as the next three rides we tried; Mantu, Cheetah Hunt, and Cobra Curse were all broken. Thus why I am writing this review. The people and the food were fantastic and the concept is there. The excuse that they run these machines yearly is not an excuse. Also, one of the workers told us that the machines break about twice daily and the customer service person said it was a weird day and that was the issue. I mean if you want to spend your money to stand in a line... then go ahead. I do not think we will be returning.",

So invited her n my mom for a girl day out of Shenanigans at BG. I noticed today was the preview of The xmas stuff n i was hopping the place wasn't nuked. On a friday? It's actually not bad. No clumping, hardly no lines. Parking wasn't full at all either. We went around 12pm it was perfect day. Rides were most under 20min waits. Got in by 1:54 plenty of time to catch the first ice skating show! I got lucky n saw my favorite dancer perform there. I been watching this guy do his magic for the past 5-9 years. I got a second favorite but this guy is so passionate n really good translating his feelings n energy through dancing on ice. He's a show runner. I hardly ever see them both on the same stage. Meaning they have become the main Dawgs in different dates. Do i know him? Yeah, personally nope. He has videos in the social media. Im good at remembering people by how they move, found him by luck. Yeah i know i sound like a stalker but a las no. Im not lol I don't ever forget beautiful n moving things. The Day was great it was cloudy all day no rain. I went with my swimsuit under a fishing hoody. I was practically naked n prepared for rain. I rode some rides just fine but age is making me sicker faster so I couldn't ride everything, also the elephant in the room (cancer) is still kicking my ass! We got on the rapids n got hella wet! Did the bumper cars n enjoy sone road rage lol Then got silly n rode the cute little roller coaster by the horse's n yup! Jump right on them to afterwards. Mom joined us. Nothing more fun than three adults riding horsies! Lol  we shopped a little n ended the night happily. My girls needed a day like this. Watching my mother smile n my girlfriend be happy is all a gal like me needs. I am content n despite how tired i feel from my sickness. It is all i ever want for my life. My girls are happy n i get to pretend I'm alright for another day. I huge thank you to the hard working performers, ride attendants, restaurants workers n everybody that create beautiful n magical moments for us guests (especially the animals n their care tackers!). Thank you n blessings to all!",

Due to covid, there were very few good options available with long lines, and they made no adjustment to allow for patrons to bring food and drink inside the park. Poor decision on their end. 70% Of the staff are rude and completely Ignorant of what to do. When told to management staff-we were told\"well they are in training\". But I see no quality check system\nIn place- anywhere. The masks when walking around is completely a joke! I can see in line or indoors make sense. Look, if we are dealing with a pandemic, then some adjustments need to be made for patrons for cheaper or more  options on water and food or allowing patrons to bring food in. We had to experience guest services due to some issues with my parents platinum annual membership and they had no idea what to do to help and told them to email customer service. It's just sad that the guest services aren't equipped to provide a WOW customer experience. For the current cost of a day pass and the pandemic- I WOULD NOT recommend this atttractjon while visiting.",

      "text": "This review took a little longer to get done than I'd have liked, but I had so much fun here I wanted to make sure I finished detailing all of the individual rides first. \n\nThe first time you visit a theme park you've never been to before is always something special. New rides, new attractions, all sorts of surprises around every corner. Busch Gardens gave me this feeling and then some. I've been to Universal Studios a few times in the past couple years, and while that's always been fun it's a different type of experience. Universal has a focus on 3D/4D motion rides, which again not complaining, but they only have two real roller coasters at the moment. Well, full disclosure, this Yelper right here is roller coaster fanatic, and as soon as I walked in the gates at Busch Gardens I looked at the park map and got a childlike giddiness I haven't had in a while. This place was my playground for the day and I couldn't have been happier. \n\nBusch Gardens Tampa is themed around African places and environments. The Cobra's Curse is in Egypt, while the Cheetah Hunt is in The Edge of Africa and Kumba runs through Congo, with the Serengeti Express running around the whole park. The park does an extremely good job giving off the appropriate vibe for the area they're imitating. Sure there are snack carts and restroom signs, but it's more immersive than just about any other park I've visited. (They're sister park in Williamsburg, VA does the same thing with a European countries idea instead of African theme here.) What I'm trying to say is this place is beautiful. It's an enormous theme park with world class roller coasters and more impressive animal enclosures than your typical zoo. There's almost too much to mention about this wonderful place but I'll try and go for the highlights.\n\n ROLLER COASTERS! Seven incredible coasters with another two being built before 2020. I've visited theme parks all up and down the east coast and some of these stand out among the best. The Cobra's Curse with it's independently rotating carts and crazy elevator lift is easily the most unique coaster I've ever been on, the giant wing and true vertical drop of Sheikra was exhilarating and Cheetah Hunt's crazy launch system, smooth ride and amazing views make it extremely well rounded and a real contender for favorite coaster of all time. \n\nANIMALS! I know the topic of zoo's can be polarizing for some, and I'm no wildlife expert, but in my humble opinion they handle the idea of animals in captivity better than most places. Alligators, Tigers, Elephants, Flamingos, Kangaroos, Gorillas, Orangutans, Giraffes. Every enclosure is massive and more than allows for the animals to move about and enjoy themselves. (The Serengeti Plain \"exhibit\" is practically a third of the whole park.) They're are at least three different areas of the park where you can get very intimate with tropical birds (while supervised by park staff). I can't say I've been anywhere else that I've been inches away from a brilliant Peacock and later the same day get bit by a Parakeet and watch a Kookaburra nesting. It really is something special. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that my visit was just before Christmas and when the sun goes down you get to see just how elaborate their lights and decorations are for the season. Traditional Christmas bulbs adorned the train station while tunnels of elaborate LEDs illuminated the paths between park sections and projectors display giant snowflakes over the gates. They go above and beyond to feel festive. \n\nIf there is anything that could be described as a \"con\" against the massive list of \"pros\" to this place it would be that they do fall victim to the curse of theme park food. Our small samplings during the day were fairly tasty, but the prices are a bit steep, the exception being the all day unlimited refill souvenir cup (which was a life saver). \n\nBusch Gardens may not be the most famous Florida theme park, but just because the pair of giants down in Orlando get all the attention doesn't mean this place can't stand on its own. It depends on what you're looking for in a theme park experience, but for me the cheaper ticket prices, far superior roller coaster selection and the plethora of animals make this place an instant win. I fully intend to make this place a recurring destination.",

What's also to be expected it to have places to get drinks and snacks.  I'd say 90% of the \"snack shacks\" were closed. I have more pictures of stuff that was closed (food, rides, exhibits) then of things that were open. I waited over an hour for a coke, waffle cone, and a funnel cake. The long food lines wouldn't be so bad if more places were open. I am highly disappointed with this trip. I'd say the best part was the bacon cheeseburger and I could've gotten just as good for a fraction of the cost outside the park.

We got in at 11am and waited two hours on Cheetah Hunt. Once we were about to get on, the ride experienced technical difficulties and shut down and all guests were recommended to leave. So frustrating but we figured we would go to the next ride and come back to Cheetah Hunt later. \n\nWe decided on Kumba next and once we got to the line we were told the ride was shut down. The park pretty much just opened and the first two rides were busts. We ended up running back and forth through the park using the Busch Gardens app trying to catch open rides only to find them \"closed temporarily\". We were mainly hoping on riding Cheetah Hunt and the Skyride. Both were closed. We ended up spending 9 hours there and only going on two rollercoasters, the log ride, and the train. Major bust if you ask me and sort of a waste of one of the days of our vacation. \n\nI would avoid this place until they get it together. I don't know if I'll make another trip here.",

Getting in the park took an hour due to no line for will call , but an influx of people trying to figure out where to go to enter. When I tell you the \"line\" was 10 people wide and we were all trying to merge into some formation for 30-40 minutes, I'm serious. No one was even trying to direct us in the correct location, we were just playing follow the leader. Also,  The machines were not working once we got to the correct entrance to scan our codes, and then lines over 70-90 minutes long for rides once inside. I understand this park is one of the only ones without a mask mandate and they are well sought out because of that, but they cannot handle the amount of business they are getting, and instead of placing a capacity limit, they waste everyone's time. Not only were lines so long, multiple rides were out of use, getting stuck, and one ride told us the ride was closed while we had been waiting in line for over 30 minutes!!! I was in the park for 5 hours and rode one ride. Save your money and go to a park that actually cares about your experience. This place used to be the cheap but fun version of Orlando's parks. Not anymore. It is extremely overpriced and cannot handle their own business. And can I say they still have animals there? I saw a single tiger in a enclosure alone that was well underweight and at least 10 penguins in a lukewarm pool the size of hot tub. I did not know they still had animals due to not going in years.

The only time where you're allowed to take them off is when you reach certain \"relaxation spots\", which are placed around the entire park.\nThe stores are opened and some restaurants (not all), however the food seems limited/ reduced. \nMy main complain is that most of the workers were very rude, I did not happen to come across a single nice staff member, which is kinda sad (bc this is coming from a kid) .",

      "text": "Don't fall for the Quick Queue trick. They making ride wait times nearly two hours long with no explanation whatsoever. 50% capacity and not cleaning seats or skipping seats/row DOES NOT equal longer wait times!  I haven't been to Busch Gardens in nearly 20 years, brought my daughter for the first time and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had. But wait, there's more. I decided to stay the night in a hotel and return the next day since we didn't get to do but a few rides yesterday. Saw online that the Quick Queue passes were $20 each but I wanted to rush to park when they opened. We get to the park, they scan our passes, then make us stand in a 2' x 3' box area saying their was a problem with my daughters pass and no further explanation. I ask whats wrong and they just said \"please wait sir\". 10 min later a manager comes back, hands the pass back and says you're ok. I asked what the problem was and she said the card shows it was scanned twice but its \"no big deal, maybe someone has the same card number\". WHAT???  She walked away and that was that. So, I decided to buy the Quick Queue passes at the park so my family and i can enjoy the day that was already starting out bad and to my SURPRISE the passes are now $70 EACH, for 4 of us!!! Customer service said \"Thats the price when you don't buy them in advance\". WHAT?!! Did the Quick Queue line suddenly get faster today and thats why the price is higher??? \n\nNote: We've been in the park 20 minutes since park opening and the rides are already 45 min to 60 min wait time and there's barely anyone here in the park. Good job in scheming people to buy Quick Queue passes\n\nI'm giving a 1 star rating to Busch Gardens for their lack of customer service and scheming skills. I would give less but the app only allows a minimum of 1",

So wonderful that we have to inhale all the second hand smoke. I went here on a Saturday and I waited in the ticketing line for at least 55 minutes. They were not fully staffed, as all booths were not open. They didn't even have fans to help circulate the air in a crowded space! Another issue was the fast pass! I paid over 150 for 3 fast passes and sometimes had to wait 15 minutes to get on a ride, despite there being no line except the general line. What's the point of paying extra....\n\n\nPros: stroller parking & tram \n\nCons: parking $25, lines are horrendous",

I have always loved this place since I was a child. \nI had a friend come from out of town and I took the family for the day. \nIt starts with 25 bucks to park the car, which is absurd.\nThen at the minimum 100 bucks apiece for all five of us.\nI have no problem with that. Where the problems begin is that most the park is closed.\nI felt like they sold us tickets to a closed amusement park. Most the rides are shut down and the bier garden was even closed and almost all concessions.\nI found it strange that the employees were very strict  about us wearing out masks even though one of my kids has Asthma but they weren't cleaning anything. \nNot even wiping down rollercoaster grips.  Two of our family members ended up with with strep throat. \nThere wasn't really even any animals to see really and the ones we did see looked sad.\nI understand Covid is scary but either open all the way or close.\nDon't charge all of us full price for a quarter of the experience.\nIt was upsetting at best and I hope you people can figure it out. Universal studios has. That's a fact. \nDon't get me wrong. I love Busch Gardens, just not at this juncture in time. \nAnd please check on the crocodile near the penguins. He has cataracts and his aquarium seems unkept. He's an endangered species.\nHeartbreaking.",

It's way bigger than the one in Williamsburg VA and you will get lost even with the map and signs. I followed all the directions and still walked for about an hour before I encountered another ride. This one also is very crowded.  I imagine because its florida the sunshine state where the weather is perfect like all the time so prepare for long lines even on off days.\n\nI will say the food was way better at this Busch gardens. I really enjoyed the Zambia smokehouse. Expensive as hell but that's to be expected. I went during the holiday special on the 30th before nye and all the Christmas lights were up and it was beautiful.  They had tons of shows for little kids with all the Christmas characters.  This Busch gardens also had some type of animal exhibit with hippos,  lions, penguins etc...like a damn zoo lol so that was interesting for a theme park.",

As a theme park, I found this place a good time!\n\nCompared to most of the parks in the Central Florida area, this park packs a high concentration of roller coasters and thrill rides into one theme park. If that's your speed, then you'll have  great time. If you're not big on these types of thrill rides, you might be better off skipping this park. Honestly, I can't say that I saw many rides that wouldn't classify as BIG thrills. For me, that was a win though! We were able to ride all the coasters as well as Falcon's Fury, the brand new face-down drop tower, in one evening!\n\nThe park seems well-cared for and while we didn't eat in the park, it seemed like there were a lot of different options, in addition to standard theme park fare. The layout of this park was a little less organized to me than other theme parks I've visited, but that could just be because I've spent more times in the Orlando parks!\n\nI had a fantastic time at Busch Gardens and hope to visit for a full day to take advantage of more of the animal related attractions.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens is a great tourist attraction, with enough roller coasters and lines to keep you occupied for most of the day. The theme park experiences a very different number of visitors each day, so some days you may not have to wait at all for rides, then other days you may be waiting for an hour or maybe more time than that.\n\nThe season passes are a pretty good deal, but you will get tired of the rides pretty quick, and it's hot everywhere around this park, it's mostly outdoors. There's a big section for little kids to play in, the biggest playground I have ever seen. \n\nService is pretty decent in the park and you really do not need to interact with workers too much, unless you are buying something to eat. The shows that they have are great for tourists or if you need to cool down under the air conditioning.\n\nThe food is delicious, but you'll have to fork over a ton of money for it. My favorite thing to get is the corn dogs and french fries in Timbuktu with a drink, which can total seven to ten dollars. They also have a restaurant inside this huge establishment that is pretty good, though still pretty expensive. They adopted an awesome buffet about a year ago.\n\nThe biggest attraction is the fairly new ride Sheikra. It is pretty exciting the first couple of times you ride it, especially the first time so don't miss it. Kumba and Montu follow in ride quality. The main thing people like about Montu is your feet hang so it feels different.",

Overlooked. \n\nNow to the coasters: order of operations is IMPORTANT in deciding your action plan, but this is how we usually roll: two montu rides. Sky ride to SheiKra. Ride SheiKra like 2-5 times depending on waits. Then maybe ride Tigris, maybe go ride Kumba. Then my child nags for drinks and we are lame so we don't have the cups. I definitely need to invest in the cups for .99 refills. For sure. Then we go wait in line for Cheetah Hunt, then sometimes we go ride Cobra's Curse because it's hilarious, and definitely end our night with more Montu rides because Montu is amazing! The other day we even went vintage and rode Scorpion. Totally bruised up over that one. \n\nIn order:\n\n1) SheiKra \n2) Tigris \n3) Cheetah Hunt\n4) Montu\n5) Cobra's Curse\n6) Kumba. Can we get a retrack please!? Kumba would be incredible if it was smooth. Too bad it is SO. LOUD. AND. VIOLENT. \n7) Scorpion\n8) that one yellow one that I never go on. Mehhh. \n\nNever again: Falcon's Fury. I've been once. I'm good. \n\nAlso never again: eating at any of the restaurants there in the park. There's a Pizza Hut, ihop and Olive Garden nearby. There's no way in hell I'm paying $50 for four sandwiches and some waters ever again. Pub subs and re enter? Maybe! \n\nEither way, BG is my absolute favorite place in Tampa. Hands down. Catch me there like 2-3 nights a week. It's my favorite!!!",

The only things i would recommend is bringing hand sanitizer to sanitize after touching high volume surfaces such as coaster bars and wear a cloth face ask as the medical grade ones tend to get very moist and uncomfortable in the park. many other reviews complain about long wait times and as rides are running at half capacity i would expect to see longer wait times so if that is a concern to you then i would recommend going during the week if you can. overall great experience especially given the lack of things to do in the area during the pandemic!",

We went today (Saturday) let me start by saying the lines to get to the parking area wore 45 min long, the lines to get to the park wore hours long (2-3) just to get in, luckily people with the tickets purchased wore going through a gate left open on the side and I went in, still waited 35 min to get the the main entrance. No one wears masks. It's not mandatory. The food lines incredibly long over 30 min. We did reservations online, looked like you really did not need them at all, I would say their wore over thousands of people their. Most sanitation stations do not have alcohol. We wore unable to ride any ride as the lines wore over 2 hours of wait. We rode the train and was good. Kids only got to ride 1 ride overall. The food was extremely expensive. 2 chicken tenders and 1 burger plus 2 fountain drinks $52. Wtf??? 1 beer, 2 ice creams $29 wtf?????? 2 coffees 1 cookie $29 wtf???? I could of went to a fancy restaurant for a couple more bucks.. their wore so many people you could not walk without being bumped into... some people skipping with their kids...some smoking wore they weren't suppose too. The lines are out of control because their aren't people directing. I barely saw any workers around the park, if you are lost you are on you're own. Would not come waste my time again.",

      "text": "Bush Gardens is pretty awesome but most of the fans are correct do not expect the Disney Magical Experience here. Also when the web site has ride updates and say 1 ride is not working it's a lie. When we went there was 4 rides that were not working including the only one I really wanted to ride was the Skyway carts. \n\nThis park is loaded with poor animals listening to roller coasters and screams all day long, however the park is elite and expansive and has lots of cool options to eat, ride, chill, and hang out. The Brazilian chanting girls are the reason for knocking off a star, Disney took care of this problem and you guys should to it's highly annoying. \n\nThe food at some grill in Patagonia was way to expensive for the quality and what your actually getting it's almost extortion as well as not having gluten-free bread anywhere in this park is the reason for knocking off another star. It shouldn't be hard to have a gluten free accommodation especially when you have these \"allergy cards\" that explain let a chef know.\n\nAlso if you want to get the $50 fast pass unlimited be sure you get it at the beginning of the park because you can not get it at the back of the park for some unknown reason, but I know! They do offer $30.99 at the back of the park for one fast pass but not the unlimited so we had to walk all the way back to the front of the park to get these fast passes. These did pay off however most of the staff didn't even care and don't double check you once you get in the fast line we witnessed a bunch of kids jumping under the line and no one to check them.\n\nPlastic Animal Making Machines are 5+ and a relic of Seaworld which I love. The elephants, cats, sloths, make this place a 5 star park. The rides are also great, and this park is a good way to spend the day. You really only need about 4-5 hours at a brisk walk to knock this park out. It didn't take THAT long.. I'd come back here with family, or friends in the future but with Disney World being so close it's hard to make that call.",

When I arrived and tried this, the machines wouldn't take them, and I had to wait 45+ minutes in the ticket line. When I finally arrived at the window to get my tickets and the Unlimited Quick Que pass, the employee informed me that the QQ price had been increased to $130 each! On their website and in all their advertising, QQ's are listed as only $20. Nowhere online does it say that their prices are subject to change or that they WILL jack up the prices on busy days.\n\nWhen we finally got to our first ride, I was told that I couldn't bring/wear my cross-body bag in line and would need to purchase a locker! Bags are allowed in the park, but they removed the bins outside rides for loose items, so you are forced to pay even more to store your belongings once inside the park!\n\nAfter 2+ hours getting tickets, finding out I couldn't have a bag, going back to my car to ditch it, then getting back into the park, we finally reached the roller coasters only to find out that even with the Quick Que ticket, we had to wait 45+ for the rides. Never in my life have we had to wait this long with Quick Q/Fast Pass tickets and because of the lines, we couldn't even take full advantage of the Unlimited Quick Que!",

They definitely falsely advertise that they are not allowing max capacity. If that was 50% capacity then I never ever want to know what that place looks like if it's busy. \n\nFirst we waited about 35 mins in line for the tram car to get to the gate, then when you get to the gate there is another line for temperature checks. This line was no joke all the way down the street and probably about an hour wait outside in the heat. I understand the necessity of temp checks but why not have multiple stations or have ppl checking in the parking lot before you park, or before you get on the tram? THEN after you get through that line you of course have to wait in the 45 minute 3rd line to get into the park. \n\nSome of the rides were not up and running,  it started down pouring and they have like 2 restaurants in the whole park to sit in to get out of the rain, one roller coaster we waited for 25 mins and then never got to go on bc it had technical difficulties. Then we went to get food at ONE of the restaurants open, and it was legitimately a 1.5 hour wait in line for the food.

      "text": "The absolute worst time I have had in an amusement park in my entire life. Decided to go to the park because of memories of fun times had when I was younger and also the fact the park has 4 out of 10 soon to be 5 out of 10 (Gwazi opening soon) roller coaster rides in Florida. Inside tip is if rides get shutdown due to weather you can get a free day at the park, but you need to ask at guest services. They do not just hand it out. I understand closing rides due to lightning metal tracks cars and everything. Rides broke down twice while in line. The last ride we were in line for was Cobra's Curse. We got in line at 5 pm and the que was 20 minutes. At 545pm they closed the ride due to maintenance. We were given a front of line pass for the inconvenience along with the 30 other people in line. Went straight to Cheetah Hunt and were told it was closed. So at 546 pm they shut it down and we could not make it to another ride with the pass we were given. So our last experience at the park was a longer then listed que, which showed 20 minutes the entire time we were in the que. So the times are not updated enough. The next item that was disappointing was how the employees appeared to be miserable. Forced to wave at a passing train each time. The que employees did not have a great attitude and just were going through the motions. Maybe mix in a hello or have a great ride sometimes. Another item that is a what the.. is the Congo River Rapids. I have been on lazy rivers that are longer than this ride. It is a circle a long que to ride in a circle with small drops that are not very rapid. I understand if it was rapid the ride would be even shorter. Longest time was loading and unloading of the ride. To end the day I waited with my family to get the ride back to the general parking area and as the tram prior to ours was leaving we were told due to lightning in the area the tram would not be running. We were told to walk. So as the rain came down I was thinking it must not be safe to be on the tram during this time. As we left I saw the trams off to the side of a parking area and the driver and second driver sitting in this lightning magnet chatting. If it is so dangerous for people that paid for so much in a day at the park, how can the park not be concerned with the employees to save them from the horrible fate. Needless to say this park needs major improvement of staff and ride maintenance. Money spent for tickets are cheaper then the mouse or Universal, but in this case you get what you pay for. I will really need to read more reviews in the future prior to taking my family for what was to be the big vacation of the year and have it be to a park that is resting on its coaster laurels and not doing anything that goes above and beyond. Get better please.",

You can pay for 1 day and get free entry for the rest of that year (if you buy it in the first few months of the year) or they also offer the EZ pay option to pay a minimal fee of $10-$15/month to get in all year. The EZ pay options also has nice bonuses including free parking and discounts on food and in the merchandise stores.\n\nWhen it comes to Busch Gardens, i'm more about seeing the animals and the bird exhibit than I am about most of the rides. The bird exhibit is really neat because you can go into their habitat and experience feeding them, which I found to be pretty neat and of course they have all kinds of  safari animals including antelope, giraffes, gorillas, elephants, etc.\n\nAs far as rides go, Kumba is not very smooth and usually gives me a headache. Gwazi is even worse, since it's an older wooden roller coaster it's so bumpy and rattling I have to check and make sure my head is still attached when I get off the ride :p. Sheikra is a fun ride with an impressive nearly 90 degree drop straight down at the beginning. I also like the Cheetah Hunt ride because it's smooth, quick and doesn't have too many crazy loops and twists. Some people might find that \"boring\", but I like to get off the ride and not feel sick lol. The water rides are nothing extremely impressive, but I like them all just fine.\n\nAlso, there are a few good shows here that they rotate and those are always a nice way to sit down and relax with some entertainment after walking around the park for so long. In addition, there is a special kiddies zone with a play area, kid friendly rides and meet and greets with various characters.\n\nThere are 2 special highlight events they do here every year: Howl-O-Scream and Christmas Town. I have been to both events once each. Howl-O-Scream is a fun night of terror, haunted houses and rides (see my separate review of that event). Christmas Town is my absolute favorite, with winter wonderland decorations, special winter animal exhibits and of course fake snow for us floridians who never get the real deal. \n\nOne thing I really wish they would bring back the anheuser busch beer house, cause that was a place to get some darn delicious beer samples while strolling though the park. *le sigh*\n\nOverall it's a fun place to go for adults, kids and families alike.",

The theme park is a decent size but does focus more on animals - which is okay with me. My two favorite rides were Falcons Fury (best drop tower I've ever been on!) and Cheetah's Run (I think that's the name). The staff was extremely good at keeping everything clean and due to this, yes the waits were pretty long but at least everything was sanitary. I will say I went to the Dragon Fire Grill for dinner which was the wrong decision. I ordered a Slushee, Beef with Broccoli and a piece of Raspberry Cheesecake and it was almost $30. My husband ordered a Burger with Fries, Soda and a Cookie and his was almost $30. The portions weren't even that big! I've been to Six Flags and they have OUTRAGEOUS prices but never even spent that much at Six Flags for a meal like that. I wouldn't go back to that grill, that's for sure. I was going to get a magnet or some sort of souvenir but after that dinner, no thanks. Regardless, it was a really nice park. Would I come back? Probably not. Would I recommend? Yes.",

We were not able to ride any roller coasters this visit as the children were present, but we love Busch Gardens so much that we bought year passes. This park is fairly large but easy to navigate. It is stroller and child friendly with smoking areas tucked away from all the foot traffic. We had great luck with the animals on this visit, they were all up close and personal which the kids really enjoyed. The Sesame Street area was great for my toddler and was a wonderful introduction for me as I am still getting used to taking her to theme parks. I also thought the food was pretty good for \"theme park food.\" The children enjoyed it as well. We will definitely be back again and again this year.. with and without the kids!!",

Once you are through the gate, they have your money and they don't care about you!\n\n1 - When we got to the security checkpoint no one was paying attention to social distancing. There was a sign but no one reminding people to observe the stickers that were on the ground. It was at this point my wife said, \"This might have been a bad idea.\" But we hoped this was only because it was the very front of the park and there wasn't a lot of room.\n2 - We walked back to SheiKra and started noticing people not wearing masks while walking through the park. SkeiKra was closed so we decided to take the train around to Cheetah Chase.\n3 - No one was observing the stickers on the ground for social distancing and there was no one asking people to observe it. They were just standing off to the side in front of the station.\n4 - We got into line at Cheetah Chase. We had to wait in a line outside the entrance where no one was observing social distancing.\n5 - When we entered the line the young woman at the front didn't remind us to stay on the stickers or keep our masks on. She simply said, \"Go ahead.\"\n6 - We waited in line for an hour with NO ONE following safety protocols. I have two pictures and a video to prove this. We tried to be mindful of the people in front of us but the people behind us were inches away, even touching us at times.\n7 - There were multiple people who were not wearing masks in line.\n8 - There was no reminder coming over the intercom while we were in line that reminded people of social distancing or wearing a mask.\n9 - There was no one going through the line making sure people were social distancing or wearing their masks.\n10 - Even when we got to the front, the employees ignored people getting on the rise not wearing masks! 11 - After we got off the ride we walked around to other rides and every single line had the same issues.\n\nWe entered the park around 11:30am, by 3:30pm we were already leaving because of the issues above.\nI have reached out to their customer service number who told me that there was absolutely nothing I could do. I used the pass and it was done. I left work early on Friday to go to the park and talk to customer service who told me they had the ability to refund customers stripped away because there had been so many similar complaints but gave me an email, BGA.GuestInformation@BuschGardens.com , but told me messaging the park on Facebook messenger was the best way to actually speak with someone. He was right but after explaining it again to them about these issues and asked for a refund because they are not following the protocols that they promised people. You don't know that they are lying on their webpage until after you visit the park, and even if you walk in and then walk out because you see that they are not following their own safety protocols they will only give you back 50% of your purchase because you have used your pass.\n\nIt is a scam.",

They actually have more roller coasters than most of the big theme parks in Orlando.  One of my all-time favorite roller coasters is Sheikra, which is a floorless, thrill ride that takes you over the edge of a 90-degree drop then stops for a few seconds as you stare straight down before dropping.  I wait in the extra long line for the front row because I love that \"I can't breathe\" feeling from the top of the coaster!  \n\nThis park has it all... it's like a mini zoo with a safari ride, zebras and tigers... shows for both the young and old... a kid's area with kiddie rides and games... and all-you-can-eat-and-drink for $29.99 (adults).\n\nMinus one star for Anheuser-Busch no longer owning the park and doing away with free beer and beer school.

      "text": "First time to Busch Gardens Tampa in about 5 years. Bought a special $99 two park ticket with plans on going to SeaWorld and Aquatica. Had an amazing day at SeaWorld. Woke up next morning to go to Aquatica and decided it was going to be too chilly most of day - barely breaking 70 degrees. So we quickly changed plans and went to Busch Gardens. Quick one hour drive from Orlando. Parking needs some work. Parking lots were really disorganized and crazy. Staff could care less. Tram was clean and quick. Got into park quick and started our day. Overall, had a good day. Looks like Busch is putting tons of money into Roller Coasters. Some really amazing ones. Shame they done take care of other areas of park. If you were in an area near one of the roller coasters, the area was nice - Clean - taken care of. If you were in an area that did not have a coaster, you felt like you were in a cheap carnival. Lots of stupid games you had to pay for, overflowing trash cans - just not the nice areas. We even saw a sign at one ride with words misspelled. Come on Busch Gardens Tampa - get your act together! Maybe hire a quality control team who simply walks around and documents issues - radios them in to a team of people to help fix these issues. Slap some paint on a few things. Clean a few things? Oh, and your staff? Most staff we came in contact with were just not interested and miserable. It's a shame. Let's talk food - we ate at some huge place - Fire Grill? It used to be the big German Fest Place. First off - take or two rows of tables away! The tables and benches are so tight, people were literally walking on benches to get to areas to sit? Secondly, get rid of the stage and cheesy rock n roll show - reconfigure the different food areas. We waited in disorganized lines - people thought they were lining up for Asian and found out they were in the Italian. We waited a solid 45 minutes in line - only to deal with the two most miserable staff at the Mexican Cantina line. They could care less what we wanted to eat - they were the slowest people ever! Our family was next to order and three times they ran out of something - ran out of cheese, lettuce, chips and don't try to order the taco salad - we don't do those taco shells anymore - the one we advertised when you got in this line. You need expediters to help replenish / maintain food from kitchen to front line. Quality control? Again, get rid of that stage, reconfigure and make it a fantastic food court.",

      "text": "We visited Busch Gardens for the Winter Christmas last night and the entire experience was lack-luster.  First, we ordered annual passes on-line, but then had to talk to the call center to correct the passes.  To say the call center experience was painful would be a HUGE understatement.  Then we arrived at the park around 6 PM, but the trams from the parking lot were limited, so a very long walk with a 3 year old was faster than the trams.  At the ticket window, there were only about 10 groups of people in front of us, but the process took about 30 minutes.  When it was finally our turn at the window to exchange our on-line passes for an annual pass, we found that the call center had made an error and put two passes under the same, but wrong name.  The employee at the ticket window was very helpful, which is the only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 star.  Finally, we were in the park, which was nice, but getting food was another painful experience.  Even though the park was nowhere near capacity, the food lines were long and painfully slow.  We finally decided on a shorter (but still long) line and got sliders and beer cheese soup.  Beside the slider being over-cooked and cold, have you ever tried eating soup with a fork?  Yep, no spoons and a passive aggressive employee response of take the fork for soup, or you get nothing.\n\nAfter a long walk back to the car because the trams were still running very slow, we wrapped up the evening being very disappointed.  I know that Busch Gardens is an institution in Tampa and my review, and others, won't make much of a difference to park management.  But maybe it will cause them to step up their game (at least a little), such as exiting the call center that creates nothing but frustration for customers.",

I've been going to Busch Gardens years, ever since I was a little kid! I liked Busch Gardens better when Anheuser-Busch was operating it and gave free beer, fireworks, and snacks. Busch Gardens was also better in 2018 but it's also maybe unfair to judge the park now with reduced capacity, covid restrictions, and the unemployment benefits crisis due to people being paid more not to work than to work. \n\nFestivals include: \nMardi Gras 8/10 \nFood & Wine Festival 8/10\nSummer Nights 6/10\nBier Fest 7/10 \nHowl O Scream 8/10 \nSesame Street Kids Weekends 8/10\nChristmas Town 10/10 \n\nRides Include: \n1.

Jungle Flyers 10/10\n\nWhile Universal's Islands of Adventure is better for  older kids and adults, Busch Gardens really offers a lot more rides for younger kids. Busch Garden's Sesame Street Safari of Fun is much bigger than Dr Seus Land at Universal. Most of Disney's Magic Kingdom is pretty young kid friendly with exception of their Rollercoasters just like Busch Gardens also has the added benefit of lots of animals on display kinda like Disney's Animal Kingdom! Universal and Disney has Busch Gardens beat for innovative food selections, movie tie-in, ride quality, theming and overrall feel. Busch Gardens food selections need a lot of work as most places just have subpar overpriced burgers, Pizza, and hot dogs aside from the seasonal festival foods. However, Disney & Universal theme parks are comparatively much more expensive for annual passes but only a little more for a one time pass. Busch Gardens let's you come back all year with a fun pass for the price of a 1 day admission! Unfortunately, Busch Gardens is way too spread out and it requires way too much walking in comparison to other theme parks in Orlando. \n\nI really hope Busch Gardens management can bring back more live shows at the Pantopia Theater and Pantopia Dragon Fire Theater, bring more popular concerts, offer a greater variety of foods at restaurants, offer a greater variety of foods at festivals, and offer more types of rides than just Rollercoasters like 4D Rides! If managment could duplicate all the international food offerings at the superior International Food & Wine fest of Busch Gardens Williamsburg VA that would be awesome!",

All of the animals are more active in the early am and late day (usually after the park closes) Staff at the park starts arriving at 4 AM so these critters are up early to. By 11-noon they are all ready for their naps and you will find many just bing lazy and napping. Not always fun for the kids. Best time of year to visit is the winter as there are less crowds (except during holidays).",

Kids play area in Sesame Street section is mostly closed. The little rides are open but there was one operator who was working two rides (but can only do one at a time) so there was a good bit of waiting here. The kids can't play in the tree house either. Pretty sure I haven't see more sour faces on my kids at a park like this before. First time we ever left a park without buying toys (they couldn't find any in the shops that were open). Waste of time for young kids during COVID restrictions. \n\nThe roller coaster lines seems short, but none of my kids are old/tall enough for these yet.",

      "text": "I was hoping to get more pictures but I was too busy riding the rides. The park is pretty large and unfortunately the full train line was down for maintenance as was the sky ride so I definitely got a workout. The pluses you can experience both animals and extreme rides all on one place. I had already been to the zoo but there are a few items here not at the zoo like lions. The cost as part of the Tampa city pass which I bought for $100 and included this as a place to visit is a great deal. Even if your paying full price it's no more than comparable parks. There are many great coasters. I rode all that were operational. I would note several are in the top ten globally in terms of number of inversions with two having 7. Also one coaster is in the top ten for longest track. The lines were non existent on this day which was another plus. Note I visited during the week on a Monday in October. They have plenty of lockers to put your valuables which is another reason I didn't get many pictures as these coasters I would advise putting the phone in the locker while riding.\n\nThere are several shows but we were focused on rides. With no lines we easily rode all coasters by 3 pm and took a 1 hr lunch break in the giant pizza hall. The food was ok while I had a pizza that tasted pretty good the mozzarella cheese sticks had sat under the heat lamp too long and had firmed back up. The cup for soda is pretty essential while it's around $15 you get free refills all day you buy it. The best part is that there is a coco cola freestyle machine that provided all the choices I like in soda. \n\nThe first ride Sheikra was amazing. It takes you up the incline and then suspends you briefly at the edge before the drop. It was very smooth and a good ride. I liked it and felt it was in the top coasters I've ridden. Also Montu felt like I was in a fighter jet with inversions leading into tight turns. \n\nThe park of course is beautifully landscaped. The only negative is the layout is very difficult to navigate there are several dead ends and a few areas where you'll backtrack to get to another area. They do have an app with gps to tell you where to go but it doesn't habe bathrooms on it. Like other parks the bathrooms will be well hidden and difficult to find so be warned try and go way before you need to as you may not be near one or you'll have trouble finding one in some parts of the park because they are well disguised to blend into the buildings.",

Now the safari is a train ride through the animal area. The use to have two free beer gardens. Now just one. And the beer only limit to two small cup. \n\nThe show at Busch Gardens is still good. The animal show, singing show, popular Elmo show, ice skating show are attraction to the audiences. I like the cheetah run. They show a live cheetah at their top speed to go after the pray. \n\nIf you go near the Christmas time, they have the Christmas town. The entire park lit up at night. It is beautiful to see from the sky lift. I still like the bumper car ride. They now has some crazy roller coasters. It definitely shake your stomach and brain.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens is part of the City Pass program which helped make our trip to Tampa very affordable. We arrived Friday midmorning. I'd recommend preferred parking if your not on a tight budget. Although there is a tram for general parking, preferred is a reasonable walk to the entrance at only a few dollars more.\n\nRain had a large impact on our experience within the park. I understand Tampa is an area with daily rain. That said I expected an amusement park built there to take that into account and have measures in place to make a rainy day still enjoyable. My expectations were not met. The most surprising was the park has major issues with water drainage. Many walkways flood and pool water. I noticed the roofs had no gutter system and therefor poured water on to guests. In addition, many outdoor exhibits had leaks so even if you found cover from rain you may still get wet. With rain comes lightning, then ride shutdowns. In fact, we only were able to experience the park safari train as all other rides of interest were shutdown. That primarily left food and shops still open; which of course cost more money.\n\nThe park appeared very clean and it wasn't crowded. One aspect that made the experience more enjoyable was the opportunities to get very up close views of animals. Some really great photo opportunities exist in this park. I was the closest I've ever been in my life to lions, gorillas, hippos, and birds. It was a great experience.",

      "text": "My wife and I are annual pass holders and we really enjoy spending as much time at Busch as possible. We will typically visit once a month for four or five hours. We rarely ride any of the rides (my wife will ride them more often than I do) because we mostly prefer to check out the animals, shows, and food. \n\nI really love the meal plan here as well. It's $35 and it allows you to have an entre, side or dessert, and a drink once per hour. My wife and I will usually share each meal, and we typically will get two meals while there. Another benefit of the meal plan is that you can have unlimited bottles of free water from any of the snack stands, as well as buy one get one on snacks and boozy drinks. All that kind of stuff adds up quickly in a theme park, so the one time $35 purchase is well worth it.\n\nThe animals are great as well and the trainers are super knowledgeable. We recently got to see one of the trainers giving some of the tigers a snack, and she was super helpful in explaining the ins and outs of taking care of tigers in captivity.\n\nAll in all, this is a great park. So why do I only give it three stars? It's not consistent. Several times in the last couple of months there have been unexpected closures of various snack booths (the tea shop, the frozen cocktail station) during the middle of park hours. Those are things that I look forward to and we haven't been able to enjoy them as we would like. Additionally, the last time we were there, the Dragon Fire Grille was closed for a private event. I get that those private events happen, but there was no signage earlier in the day letting folks know that it was going to close early. We walked by around 2:00 PM and saw things functioning normally, but when we stopped back by at 5:00 PM, there was a sign showing it was closed. A sign at 2:00 PM letting folks know that it was closing early would have been appreciated.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this isn't going to stop me from coming back. However, it is disappointing to keep seeing things that are closed with little or no warning.",

Parking was easy, but was surprised they were only running one tram to the main gate (at half capacity due to COVID), so we ended up hoofing it. \n\nDidn't take too long to get in since we pre-purchased tickets online. The park is a bit meandering and kind of tough to walk through but is also a big loop. We knew it was going to be a bit of an atypical experience because of COVID and came with an open mind. Like everyone probably does we started the day at Cheetah hunt and a 45 minute line. We were worried the rest of the day would be like this so from our phones bought the speed pass (which is more the day of than purchasing in advance). We ended up skipping this line, but the rest of the park had relatively minimal lines (as did Cheetah Hunt later in the day).\n\nMuch of walking though the part was a bit strange due to how little was open. They had some food and beverage stations, but through the whole park only three full restaurants were operating. Unfortunately we didn't realize this so ended up walking halfway around the park at lunch time. \n\nSince I have family in the area, I'm sure we'll come back again one day, but likely not for a very long time.",

It's pretty fake, with lots of tall roller coasters, some of them quite fun, and many themed areas. \n\nThe real selling point for people of all ages here, are the interactive animal experiences. From having birds land on me to petting and feeding wallabies and kangaroos to just watching the more exotic apes, tigers, lions etc. play in their very well crafted and maintained environments; this place is hard not to fall in love with.\n\nThere are all kinds of shows there, as well. From street shows with break dancing and magic to free live shows (like their jungle on ice skates show which is super weird and fake but beautiful) you will probably find something you enjoy.\n\nI went on a mildly rainy day, which in my experience is the best day for any theme park. 5 minute waits on rides, little lines and not too crowded everywhere, which is really nice.

      "text": "Why 2 stars?  Because there are 2 good rides.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI'm probably spoiled from growing up in Houston (Six Flags Astroworld) and spending many summers in Cleveland (Cedar Point.)  Astroworld was unfortunately closed down in 2005, but they had about 12 big thrill rides before going under.  Cedar Point is the #1 park in the world with 17 roller coasters and a handful of other thrill rides.  Busch Gardens has 5 roller coasters, and 3 of them are either boring or just painful.  \n\nGwazi: 1/5 *****\n\nDo not ever ride this.  It hurts.  It is not fun in any way, shape or form.  There is a sign outside of the ride that says, \"New smoother track installed for 2011.\"  I don't want to call this a lie, but it's completely untrue.  Is that a nicer way of saying it?  The track feels like it was installed in 1968 and has never once even been sprayed with an ounce of WD-40.  I would actually give this ride a negative rating, because you will need a deep tissue massage when you're done with it.\n\nKumba 2/5 *****\n\nIt's not painful, but it's a ride that you could fall asleep on.  It's incredibly boring as there are no feelings of \"G-Force\" at any point.\n\nMontu 2/5 *****\n\nSimilar to Kumba, but slightly more exciting.  There are no G-Force moments, but it has the slight edge over Kumba.  We'll officially give Montu 2.2 stars.\n\nShiekra 5/5 *****\n\nShiekra is a great ride.  Being suspended at the top of the hill as you stare down at your death is awesome.  It's even at about a 110 degree inverse angle to add to the horror.  No matter how many times I ride it, I am nervous waiting in line.  That's when you know the ride is good.  I got a couple of butterflies just thinking about it.\n\nCheetah Hunt 5/5 *****\n\nCheetah Hunt is a pioneer in the new generation of roller coasters.  As we move forward, the days of the 200, 300 and 400 foot hills will slowly dissolve with new thrill rides.  Cheetah Hunt does not have any huge hills, but the ride is all about precision of the turns and placement of quicker, smaller hills with speed boosters built in.  The G-Forces are plentiful in this ride despite its biggest drop only being 130 feet.\n\nAnimal Exhibits 4/5 *****\n\nThe Lion area was definitely the highlight of any animal sightings.  There was a large window into one of the Lion's den that was gathering a huge crowd.  One of the Lions was standing on the ledge trying to directly interact with the people watching.  He/she was standing upright and pawing at the window in a non-aggressive manner, and it was a sight to be seen.  \n\nThe animal exhibits are a nice touch to the park, but they definitely create an incredible amount of walking space to get from one attraction to the next.  Be prepared for a ton of walking.  In terms of any animal related attractions, Lowry Park Zoo is a much cheaper alternative.  LPZ is only a couple of miles from Busch Gardens and has just about everything you would find at Busch.\n\nThe bottom line is that Busch Gardens is essentially good for two roller coasters.  You could walk in, ride Cheetah Hunt, ride Shiekra and leave.  Unfortunately it's a pricey ticket for a couple hours of line waiting and four minutes of coaster riding.",

      "text": "Ever been a bit more than pleasantly surprised? I am vacationing with teen boys... yes, the hard to please demographic. Ugh! aww man! I dragged them out of bed this morning, hustled them to get into the car. Sped to the complimentary bus pick up point (bus almost left us - note the bus was pulling out exactly ON TIME!). The dreaded looks I got on the hour ride from Orlando.\n\nSo you see five stars right? Those skeptics I dragged out of bed this morning had the time of their lives!\n\nThe assumption was \"gardens and animals with one or 2 mediocre rides.\" Now they can't say one bad thing. The thrills of the rollercoasters, the shows, the train ride through the mini safari, the food, the deserts (the deserts were GONE before I could get a pic), no complaints.\n\nSo I would STRONGLY advise first time visitors like myself to get there for the 10am park opening and head to Cheetah Hunt rollercoaster FIRST. We got there at about 10:45 and the wait was already 50 minutes. Next, the Cobra's Curse - that was 45 minutes. All other rides were 15 to 30 sometimes less. I was told by a regular, those lengthy wait times happen because those rides are the first to open. So best to get there early, get them done, then cruise through the rest of the park.\n\nThe event/shows schedule can be picked up with the nap at the front gate. Super easy to plan your entire day so that you see all you want to see and do all you want to do.\n\nRides for all age groups. Exciting atmosphere. And the lights at night are beautiful. \n\nTruly a fun day with teenage boys!  Will return next year same time with the entire family!",

The annual pass offers free parking as well as a 20% discount on food and gift shops in the park. \nMy favorite place to eat is at the Zambia Smoke house in Stanley Ville. It has the best pulled pork and coleslaw!! It is also very close to Sesame Street safari play area where we spend most of our time. This play area has tons to do, plenty of kids rides and a large rope bridge style jungle gym for the kids to climb over the entire area! \nJungala is another fun area for kids as it has a tree top area for kids to explore as well as 2 splash pads (there is one splash area in Sesame Street play area as well). So it's a good idea to bring bathing suits even if your kids are too small for water rides.\nSince this place is half theme park and half zoo we like to spend half our time in Africa!! This is where you can go to see the lions, elephants and hyenas! My favorite animal to visit is the hippopotamus!! This hippopotamus area is the best I have ever seen as it has both an above Water exhibit and an aquarium style area where you can see the hippopotamus swim with the fish and ducks! \nWe come here very frequently, especially during the weekdays when there are less crowds! They have many events through the year with live music and fancy food pairings that can't be missed! Oh and try the fudge at sultans sweets it's amazing!!",

All lines are more than 60 minutes long.....to include lines for food and water. 1 hour wait for chicken strips?? C'mon. We arrived at 10am and by 2 pm we rode 1 roller coaster, got one drink, and got to ride the train for only half the distance, as they force you off. We paid to wait in lines and nothing more. Not all of the food places were open, which led to more overcrowding at the couple places open. In fact, most were closed.\n\nZero covid protocol enforcement, except when it comes to skipping seats on rides. As long as you have a mask on the ride, you can walk about freely without wearing a mask. This includes the minimum employees who are barely working. All photos were taken from a position where an employee was standing watching and not enforcing anything.\n\nBathrooms needed serious attention, as did all of the over flowing trash cans within the park.\n\nDo NOT waste your money until they can hire more employees, otherwise prepare yourself to pay money to stand in sunny lines, suffer heat stroke and dehydration all while getting maybe 3 rides in for the day.",

Spent a couple of hours and had a pleasant day. When we have more time or feeling up to it, we'll come back and ride the coasters. Speaking of, they are building a new ride at the moment. I feel, like they are always adding more rides or updating/improving the old ones. Good times every time. We don't have kids, but we see many families with small children.

The Sheikra is NOT my thing.  I would prefer to stay on the ground and gnaw on a turkey leg while drinking a beer and watch the monkeys play.  Now that that information is out of the way, here is my review:\n\nGreat theme park at a good price.  There is a lil sumpin sumpin for everyone at Busch Gardens.  If you are a thrill seeker, there are several roller coasters.  My favorite is Montu (because I'm a wimp and this one doesn't have a big drop), but I've been on all of them at one time or another.  Cheetah Hunt is a very smooth and awesome ride, too.\n\nIf you are into animals, there are quite a few.  I was bummed that they shut down the African Safari ride last time I went there (yes, I know it was a kids ride, but I LIKED it).\n\nThe shows are really great, too.  Last time we were there we checked out the sing off show and the Sesame Street show (am I a child?).\n\nAll in all...  BG is where it's at for an inexpensive and fun day at a theme park.",

The park was not crowded, lines for rides were reasonable even given many rides were not open. They seemed to rotate opening & closing rides, which was fine. The park was clean, and the staff was nice. \nMany of the food courts were closed and again that was ok, Except the food that was available was absolutely Terrible. We paid almost $50 for 2 meals, Asian fusion- chicken teriyaki and it was disgusting. It was tossed in trash. \nI would recommend packing PB & J sandwiches to take in. Save yourself.",

The months of February & March were the best times to visit this year - good shows & cool temperatures with no rain. We also enjoyed going when the park first opened in the morning, for the best parking places and when the crowds were thin. \n\nI've lived in the Tampa area since 1959, when the park was free and the parrot shows, brewery tour, & free beer were the highlights of the park. It's grown, and so much of the park is wonderful to just look at as you walk around. If you are a couple, to save money consider buying one annual gold pass and one annual fun pass. The annual gold pass includes complimentary preferred parking, digital photo pass, 2 complimentary passes during non-blackout dates, and a complimentary safari.  It pays for itself!",

      "text": "As someone who has been to Disney World three times in the past year and every other theme park in Florida at least once, I like to think I'm pretty good at reviewing theme parks. Please note that this review is basked on when I went, on a Sunday during Food and Wine Festival on a concert (Cole Swindell) day, so there was probably more people in the park than most other days of the year. \nPROS:\n-CHEAP.\n One day (Friday-Sunday) pass to Disney- $122. \nThree day pass to any of the follow parks for any days: SeaWorld Orlando, Aquatica Orlando, Busch Gardens Tampa or Adventure Island Tampa- $110 (Undercover Tourist).\nYou can not beat that price!!! \n-Short Lines\nBecause of the amount of attractions and the size of the park there most lines are short. The longest line I waited in (Cheetah Hunt) was 40 minutes. At Universal or Disney this would be seen as a short wait. \nCONS:\n-Rides Break a lot.\nBoth times I have gone to Busch Gardens, my experience has been effected by rides breaking down. It really puts a strain on the day when you have it planned out which rides you are going to when, and  you get there are two rides in a row are broken! Seems like a big issue there. \n- Food is nothing to ride home about.\nAlthough I did not purchase it, my mom and brother purchased the meal plan. for $20 they could eat once an hour and have up to 24 drinks (non alch) a day. THIS IS A GREAT DEAL. I did not buy it, and paid $18 on just one meal: Entree and desert. For the rest of the day we all shared food because of the meal plan. Also, it was nice to be able to go get bottled water whenever. I would highly recommend this and will be purchasing it if I ever go again. BUT: The food is nothing great. You can tell all of it is frozen, pre-made, and made in HUGE quantities. But to be fair, I experience this in all theme parks except for Animal Kingdom and Epcot.\n \n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend Busch Gardens to a family looking for a day of inexpensive theme park fun. But remember! The best deal for multi day, multi park tickets is on Undercover Tourist!",

Don't even buy the day of meals cuz you would just be standing in lines for hours and hours.  Unacceptable.  Sorry we went.  Seeing the animals was nice, the safari train was good and the lines in the kiddie area weren't bad at all.

The \"hospital\" is a great stop in the morning as you get to see a lot of different procedures on a variety of animals.   The majority of the animal enclosures are really nice and the animals seem content and healthy.  We have thoroughly enjoyed watching the babies of many of the animals grow up.  \n\nWe are not big on rides, but have done a few of the coasters and Cheetah Hunt is a favorite.   The train to view the animals is not one of our favorites as it seems to break down often and doesn't add all that much to the animal encounter.  Take all the walks, they are more enjoyable.\n\nMany of the shows are good, and the music sessions in the early part of the year are great,  but get your seats early as the theatre fills up quickly.   We love Christmas in the park as the decorations are beautiful and Christmas Town gets us in the holiday spirit.\n\nFood is hit or miss.

After 30 mins of discussions and denying the discount even though was told day before that guests would get 50% off they continued to deny it. Eventually they did give us the discount but took forever. At the same time others behind us overheard our situation and became concerned about their guests getting the discount and were on the phones. \nonce in park-most food places were closed. So when we needed food everyone flocked to same few places. We stood in line for 2.5 hours for cold chicken fingers and hard waffle fries. The girl running thr stand near the Tigris roller coaster who was cooking the chicken fingers and waffle fries snack bar was the absolute slowest human being on earth. She did not try to hustle knowing there was a line and how long people were standing there. She continued to look at her phone and slooooowly get food. My toddler was losing his ever loving mind with hunger bc we can't bring snacks in- but not small snack bars with small lines existed there in the park That I could go to to help with his hangry self! At this point we had gone in ONE ride. It took over an hour to get on. EVERYTHING TOOk OVER AN HOUR TO GO ON. UNLESS YOU SPENT THE EXTRA $100/person fast pass- but we even noticed people were still waiting long time to get on rides. Basically- barely got on any rides bc of long lines and time- long lines for food which made it not worth the trip. Half of the events were closed and cafes. Waited almost 2 hours to ride train bc they had to skip every other row for social distancing- it's outside and we all had masks on?!? Not necessary. Our trip to Busch Gardens in a nutshell Will be remembered as the day we waited in line not the rides. NOT WORTH THE MONEY! Go to Aquatica! It was awesome.",

I decided to become a pass holder again this year, and after a handful of visits, I miss the park we used to visit when it was owned by Anheuser-Busch. I miss what I feel was overall, a more customer service oriented environment. What happened?? \n\nYes, there are more roller coasters and I love them. But they've closed down and scaled back on many of the areas and attractions that made the park unique. \n\nI'm sure the annoyances I've experienced recently are unique to my personal circumstances, but I waited so many years for the time when my son would finally enjoy coasters, and it's finally here! We enjoy going to the park together with minimal personal items, and closing the storage cubes at all the coaster exits \"for the safety of the guests\" is just a load of crap. They've been there since the beginning of time, and no one has ever stolen my drink cup, flip flops, or sunglasses (if you want to leave your purse/valuables in an insecure cube, you're an idiot). Today, we could not step in line with a refill cup because the cubes were closed. We were also told that we couldn't wait together and take turns riding while the other held the stupid cup at the exit, that we'd have to get back in line a second time. Or, we could rent a locker ($2 each area, $8.00 all day...this makes buying the stupid refill cup completely pointless if you have to pay $8 a day to store it in a locker!)\n\nI told my son to go ahead and ride alone while I waited at the exit. While waiting there, I watched every coaster (10-12) pull away with *never less than 4 open seats each time. My son patiently waited in line for 40+ minutes to ride alone with an empty seat next to him. So my next question is why hasn't Busch Gardens caught on to \"single rider lines\" yet??? \n\nI wouldn't mind a few changes so much if we were at least given some advance warning. As a pass holder, I get emails regularly...you think they could  have mentioned this at some point, somewhere before we got into the park. \n\nDespite having to enforce stupid policies, I find the staff (*most of them) to be very polite and friendly. The food is hit or miss. I usually wait to grab something after we leave, but I had a $10 credit that had to be used so we got chicken tenders, waffle fries, and chocolate cake. I thought the chicken tenders were fantastic at Howl O'Scream, but must have been really hungry because today nothing tasted very good.\n\nDespite my dissatisfaction, I have an entire year to go, so I will make my adjustments as needed, get my fill and (more than) money's worth, and look into Universal passes next year!",

My kids rode one roller coaster and process took 2.5 hours. Had meal voucher so went to eat after the one ride. it took 2 hours on the food line. The place was overcrowded, even with reservation process. I can't believe how overcrowded with covid. We left after eating, which we only ate because of food voucher and we were starved at that point being there for 5 hours and getting on only one ride.  It was the biggest disappointment for myself and kids. I can't believe they allow this during covid. Have been to all Disney parks, and universal. This was worst experience I've ever had.

The lines for food were ridiculous and in most cases most of the food was sold out. The lines for the rides  were reasonable but at least 5 of the major rides attractions and shows were closed. Half of the drink and snack stands were closed. Once again I understand that Covid has some effect on normal operations, but when one asked to pay full price for tickets (120$), you have expectations that you can have a reasonable enjoyable experience. We left the park after 3 hours which was not  planned.",

      "text": "Busch Gardens is a unique amusement park, essentially a Six Flags and a zoo put together. This hodge podge at times seems a bit strange, but I enjoyed the variety - and hopefully the diversity of attractions means there's something for everyone in your party!\n\nMany of the roller coasters are a bit short and may have long waits. If you're going during a busy season, a fast pass will likely be a wise investment. Though I came in December, so it was pretty empty. The animal attractions are pretty cool, with some of my favorites being the kangaroos, the interactive bird houses, and the big cats. You can also take the train through the large plains to see more animals that aren't as easy to see from the pathways.\n\nPricing can be pretty steep - as much as $100 per person or more! But if you get the Tampa Bay City Pass, that can make it more affordable (as long as you also want to do other bay attractions). Also, while the park itself is nice, the area it's in is a bit run down, so be aware of that if you're booking lodging or finding parking (it's best to pay for the park parking, even if it's pretty steep). Overall a fun experience if you're a fan of thrill rides and wild animals.",

      "text": "My boyfriend and I just purchased platinum annual passes a few days ago and have gone twice now. We appreciate the free preferred parking that comes with our platinum passes. We are from Georgia and have season passes to Six Flags which we've been going to all summer... and let me just say, Busch Gardens blows Six Flags out of the water. Busch Gardens is SO clean, the staff has been nothing but immensely friendly, the rides have LOTS of variety, the wait times aren't too terrible, all prices are reasonable, and there are plenty signs and maps located throughout the park to help us figure out where we are.\n\nThe ONLY warning I give to you inquisitive potential park-goers is this:\n\nThere are lots of wasps (mainly in the summer) and you very well may get stung by one. I got stung by one DURING the Cheetah Hunt ride on my back. I am pretty sure that the wasp somehow got behind my back right before the coaster took off, and then when the ride took off, I leaned back and got stung. I thought that the ride had somehow electrocuted me at first because it hurt so badly. Then I quickly remembered seeing the wasps all over the park and realized I had been stung. The first aid employee was able to give me Benadryl and some sting cream that helped. Another park employee told me that Busch Gardens sometimes closes the park just to spray for wasps so I know they are at least trying to get it under control. (So I'm not mad!!!) I still plan on going and can't wait to ride Cheetah Hunt again! Haha.",

      "text": "If I could give my review a title, it would be 'LOL' because this place is a joke. \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been here twice and have had an awful time both times. Before the pandemic, it was raining the entire time we were there and pretty much every single ride was closed. What kind of theme park doesn't have one or two indoor attractions available to do when it rains? Busch Gardens, I guess. Anyway, they gave us a rain pass so we could come back another time.\n\nWe came back this weekend and greatly regretted it. \n\nSocial distancing is not being enforced by park employees AT ALL and many guests were walking around the park with their masks off. The park was not clean, as one of my friends said when they went to the restroom that there was actual crap all over the walls. The ride wait times were severely under-estimated, meaning you would get in line expecting an hour-long wait only for the wait to be over two and a half hours long, which is stupid. \n\nThe lack of maintenance for the rides here is ridiculous. The worst part of the day was when we got in line for Sheikra and waited over two and a half hours only for the ride to \"break down\" and for everyone to have to leave the line when the park closed. \"Break down\", my butt! Very obvious that the employees just wanted to go home. Do they only have like one maintenance guy handling all of the rides here? I've never operated an actual theme park, but I've played enough rollercoaster tycoon to understand why that doesn't work.\n\nMy friends and I were here for over eight hours and only got to ride one ride. We had actually gone for my friend's birthday and she was super upset because she didn't even get to have a good time. \n\nAfter the park closed, my girlfriend and I went to guest relations to tell them about our poor experience to see if there was anything they could do. We ended up speaking with that department's manager named Mike. I do not understand how he got promoted to his position with such poor customer service skills. He did not listen to our concerns. We told him that we would like reimbursement for our parking and our food, then he started going off about how he couldn't reimburse out park ticket. We weren't ASKING for our park ticket to be reimbursed! Learn to listen to people! Then he starts saying that he can't reimburse our parking or our food because we don't have the receipts for them. Who keeps the receipts for those things? No one does! He then starts saying that if he were to give us the money for those things without a receipt, it would look like he was stealing from the company. Ridiculous! I work in customer service and would never say something to a customer to insinuate that they are trying to make me do something illegal. \n\nHe then suggests that we go back to our car to get the receipt for our parking and come back in to get reimbursed. What?! He expects me to go all the way back to my car to get a receipt only to not be able to get back into the park because firstly, the park is closed, and second, I don't even have a ticket anymore because the front gate employee took my rain pass when I came in???!!! Make it make sense, sir! \n\nThe absolute worst part was when Mike threatened to call security on my girlfriend because she had the audacity to use a curse word when describing how awful our experience was. She basically said another version of, \"I've had a crappy experience today,\" and he threatened to call security on her for \"cursing at him.\" What a joke! You don't threaten to call security on people for relaying to you how poor their experience was! THAT IS YOUR JOB! YOU WORK IN GUEST RELATIONS! If she had been swearing AT HIM and calling him curse words, I would have understood the need to call security, but it was very obvious that he just didn't want to help us. The icing on the cake was that the only resolution he could provide to us was another rain pass when we had already asserted multiple times that we didn't want to come back! Why would we want to come back when we've already had two terrible experiences here? \n\nThe cherry on top of this crappy cake is that he then recommended that we send Busch Gardens an email with our receipts to request the reimbursement through that means. We asked what the guarantee was that we would be reimbursed if we send them and he says, \"there isn't any.\" Again, LOL! So I'm supposed to waste my time tracking down receipts and sending them to Busch Gardens so they can 'maybe' do something to help me? Again, what a freaking joke! \n\nBusch Gardens is a crappy theme park, before and during pandemic. The coasters are fun, but that doesn't mean anything when everything else about the park sucks so bad to the point where you hardly even get to experience them. DO NOT waste your money here! If you are looking for a theme park in Florida that is operating properly during pandemic and is actually fun, go to Universal Studios instead.",

      "text": "This trip was a huge disappointment. As pass members, we love this park but with the current restrictions we really haven't ventured anywhere. Decided to try the park with reservations, hoping for a relaxed family experience. Boy, were we shocked to see the crowds.  There was TOO MANY people and very few rides, shows, or stores operational.  Not even the tram takes you to the entrance. Your dropped off down the road to begin the day of walking to nowhere.\n\nThe crowds were too heavy with some areas bottlenecking. Yes, employees are walking around with signs that say social distancing, but we had to remind folks to back up. The masks are on the whole time, which is okay if everyone kept their mask on, which they don't. We did see security telling folks to put their mask on and over their nose, as we walked among the crowds.\n\nBut the major blow was that all the shows were closed up, plenty of the rides were too. So what ended up happening in the rides that were open, you were looking at 90+ minutes wait. There was nowhere to go, with this many people and so many activities and shows not available. Plus, I hated not having a map, none are being given to guests, to help guide us along and better inform us of what was available. Just to spend the day walking around, to find that rides are closed or have extremely long crowded waits is not acceptable.\n\nPaid for preferred parking for our family member's vehicle and when we got there they inform us that the lot was full. Then we had to stand in the customer service line for over an hour to be given a refund with Busch money. It takes them 30 to 60 days to issue you a credit card refund. That's awful, especially when it only took them a second to charge it!\n\nYes, seeing the one elephant was cute. Taking a one-way train ride after a 40 minute wait to see the other animals running free was cool too. But walking by and not spotting any of the lions, cheetahs, or monkeys was disappointing. Even the penguin tank had maybe 10 in there.  \n\nBusch could do better and they had in the past. This was a mistake and glad we had passes, for we have hope it can only get better.  Feel sorry for all those families that paid the extreme one day ticket per person to have nothing at the end of the day, except perhaps a picture with a mask on by a lighted tree.",

I saw they have the Christmas light town so I figured so that, explore what animals they have and get on some rides. You do have to make reservations before you go but they still let you in if you don't. I guess it's luck. The day I went it was ridiculously packed! I probably waited in line between75-120 minutes between each ride, only got on three of them! I didn't like that. Another thing is you have to use lockers and you have to pay for them. Every other theme park I have gone to, they have cubby and you leave your stuff there until you get back. Not sure if it's a new thing with Covid. So you pay $2 for first hour then $1 for each consecutive hour or $8 for the day. Anyways so park is huge they have lots of animals and rides. Parking if free is you have silver or up passes.

      "text": "This started as an exciting trip to Busch Gardens in Tampa. I'm not from Florida but I have traveled the world and have visited many  theme parks. \nToday, 23 November 2021, my husband, son, mother-in-law and niece started at Busch Gardens around 2 pm and we bought the express pass ($69.00 each) to skip all of the ride lines because it's my husband and My vacation before we both start our next military duty station. We started off in the Emporium and bought super cute refillable cups. As we walked the entire park, we found that all of the rides were \"temporarily closed\" except the ride Mantu, to our knowledge. All of the refillable stations were closed and the one we did find had a long line and didn't open until 4 pm. The three disrespectful girls that were working at this beverage stand next to the swan garden sculpture and Iron Gwazi (which didn't open until March 2022) have no customer service skills. My husband approached the stand and asked if they refilled the water cups there and with attitude one of the girls shoot her head no. He shook it off and went back into the line with my mother-in-law. Finally it's there turn, they approach the counter once more my mother-in-law asks \"What products do you have?\" The girl behind the counter, with attitude says water. So, my mother-in-law asks if they have sprite and the girl just said \"water\". My mother-in-law said,\" Y'all don't have anything else?\" She shook her head saying no. We have water. My husband walks back up and says \"ma, they have coke, I'm looking right at it.\" The girls response was, \"well if you knew that then why'd you even ask?\" My husband told her his mother was asking and she wasn't telling her.  I understand there was a long line (as these girls who were working this station kept saying in front of all of the customers) but they literally just opened the stand and already complaining for everyone to see. As Military, it's hard to believe that there are such unprofessional and disrespectful people out there when literally all they have to do is go to work, put on a smile for a couple hours and sell prepackaged beverages. Other than this, the park was beautiful and there were plenty of photo opportunities. We got our caricature drawn around 7 pm and the lovely artist did an amazing job, I can't wait to hang it up in our house,Thank you for that experience. She was so kind and very professional. We made the most out of our trip so it still turned out amazing but it only takes one bad experience to ruin a good time and that's unfortunate. I hope y'all find this helpful so you aren't disappointed. Have a great trip!",

Never did I see the \"task force that is leading the Coronavirus preparedness and response activity\" that Busch Gardens claims they've hired. I absolutely did not feel safe while I was there. The ride attendants ALL were rude and spoke with a dry and unfriendly tone. People are walking around with no face covering or not wearing them correctly. There is very few employees walking around enforcing and monitoring the guest. We found 2 securities and 1 employee standing all together but not correcting the offenders. Guest walked directly in front of them eating and drinking while waking and they wouldn't say anything. I watched guest be allowed in to the park with no face covering and later handed a mask on a ride. I couldn't take it anymore so I decided to go to guest service and asked for a refund. After expressing to the supervisor my feelings and concerns and even provided her with dozens of pictures of people walking with no face covering she wouldn't refund me my ticket. Her response was \"if I didn't feel safe than I should have not entered the park.\" I expressed to her that obviously if I would've seen before hand what I saw threw out my two hours at the park I would have not wasted my time and especially my money.  I don't think I should be the one to have to stay out of the park when I am the one following the rules. The CDC and our governor need to step in and take action against Busch Gardens for the lack of responsibility and the over excessive capacity in the park.",

      "text": "Cobra's Curse...more like Kumba's Curse. Over ten years ago I went to Howlscream at Busch Gardens and someone threw up while on the front row of Kumba and it caused a 30 minute clean up delay. I had yet to witness a delay at Busch Gardens over the years until today. My friends and I decided to wait a little longer to be front row on Kumba and lone behold, as we were about to get on the rollercoaster next, a girl threw up in the front row. What was more disturbing was how the team cleaned it up. They used a spray hose to spray it down with water which caused it all go to the floor where you exit the ride. They ran the rollercoaster cars twice to dry it off and then sprayed it clean. It took about 30 minutes and seemed like the crew was figuring it out as they went. It's concerning that they did not have gloves nor did they wash their hands after. Working healthcare myself, Busch Gardens should provide their staff with PPE for moments like this.\nOther than \"Kumba's curse\", the Skyride, Cheetah Hunt was closed in the morning, and Kobra's Curse was closed. Being a Florida resident, visiting parks in the winter months seems like off season is the worst time to visit which is why the Christmas Town happens. I was also disappointed that the safari ride seems to be only something guests pay for now as an extra excursion.",

Just really expensive.\n\nMost of the restaurants were closed so we had to look forever to find a restaurant we could use the free meal at, and because it was the only one open it was like a 30-40min wait.\nThe servers were the LEAST FRIENDLY people I have ever encountered.

The employee collecting the money says, \" No, but I appreciate your service so go right ahead!\" I thought that was really nice considering they didn't have to do that! We went on a school day so the lines were not long at all which made the experience fantastic. My brothers and sister and I are rollercoaster lovers so we definitely made it a point to go on all the rides two or three times. I appreciate the length of all of the rides. Usually the rides at amusement parks are super short after the initial plunge or whatever the special feature of the ride is but the rides here make waiting for them not so bad. Trust me, as soon as you think you were done you were plunging into another series of twists and turns and we loved every minute of it. The rides are awesome and puts the Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA to shame, even though I would still go there if that was my only choice, lol. \nThey do have a zoo of some sort and animal exhibits which are not my thing at all. i always think the animals look sad.\nAll in all I am definitely looking forward to returning to ride the rides! We had reservations at a restaurant for later so we actually didn't eat or drink anything at the park but they have a lot of different options available.\n(The admission price is a little ridic, but the rides are amazing so............)",

I had expected so much more.\n\nThey have removed almost all of the hand sanitizing stations which were located everywhere throughout the Park.

      "text": "Busch Gardens is one of those Tampa Bay staples that every local should be going to at least every other year or so. This theme park is more than just rides: they're a venue which hosts all kinds of events (food and wine festival), they're a zoo, and they're a garden. There's also alot of education they provide about the animals and plants they host. Now I do have one disclaimer which is that I didn't go on any rides or roller coasters besides the train and the carousel, but this is a testimony that there-s something for everyone, whether you're a thrill-seeker, adrenaline junky, or just wanna get away from everything. Perfect place to go for holidays and special events. I myself come every year for their Howl-O-Scream event ALMOST every year but one. This is my second time coming out to their Christmas Town where everything is decked out for the holidays. We spent seven hours at the park, and in those seven hours we did alot that was not roller coasters or rides. We went on the train and saw the animals: antelope, giraffes, rhinos, and zebras wandering and roaming freely. Then we went on the other exhibitions and saw the chimps and even had a chance to go underneath a tiger in his enclosure. We had a chance to pet baby kangaroos and be surrounded by birds. The food here is good, but menu is limited and pretty pricey. I highly recommend the smoked chicken, which was large, fall off the bone, and full of smoke flavor. It really hits the spot on a warm day with sone coleslaw and waffle fries.",

      "text": "If you plan to visit Tampa, I HIGHLY recommend getting the city pass. For roughly $120 per person you get admission to five main attractions, one of them being Busch Gardens. My boyfriend and I knew we made an excellent choice getting the city pass when we arrived at BG and saw that general admission was $95. And parking is $17. Yeah, it's expensive but the park needs to be maintained somehow. I think it's worth paying that much to go to Bush Gardens. It's like a zoo and amusement combined together. It's huge and it has an African theme. My boyfriend and I had a blast here. The lines were short and the longest we waited in line was 20 minutes. I really had fun feeding the kangaroos and birds. Food is expensive, so we got one entree and split it. Busch Gardens isn't just for kids- it's for everybody! There is a lot to see and do. It's too bad BG closes early!",

      "text": "Wow oh wow. What a terrible place all around. I have never in my life been to a park that was more disorganized, horrendous and all around bad. This park deserves negative stars and I honestly can't comprehend how it has so many positive reviews in the first place. The wait to get into the parking lot  alone takes HOURS because the entrance they've created is just plain stupid and created a ridiculous traffic jam. We ended up parking elsewhere and walking in to save time. \nOnce your finally in, good luck trying to find any rollercoaster, let alone ones that are actually open. They have so many signs that lead you to absolutely nowhere because apparently following the arrows is the wrong thing to do when trying to find anything. We looked and walked for half an hour trying to find any rollercoaster entrance or even an employee to help but there were none to be seen anywhere. I'm not one to write negative reviews but I've been to dozens of parks in my life and this is easily the worst with no competition. I wish I had more words to describe how bad the experience has been but I'll leave it at this: I created a Yelp and wrote this whole ass review while waiting in line for the first ride we have been able to find all day and we still have an hour to go (supposedly) on wait time. -100/10 do better.",

      "text": "Went today with some friend to spend our afternoon doing something fun. Today was the first time riding Tigris and cheetah hunt and I can say that both rides are for people looking for that high but can not do larger coasters that have to many loops or goes to high. The first thing that gets your blood moving with both rides is the acceleration using magnets to get both rides upwards speeds of 45 for Tigris and 65  MPH for cheetah hunt.\n\nOne highlight for each ride that makes them both so unique is that cheetah hunt towards the end, zig zags like how cheetahs would run after their prey and with Tigris having multiple twists through out the ride to give you that \"big coaster loop\" feel. \n\nThe wait time for cheetah hunt as of today was only at 5 minutes since they have two coaster cars verses the 20 minutes you can expect for Tigris with it only having one coaster car. Both rides regardless of wait times are both worth the wait. \n\n10/10 perfect for a fun family night out weather you are a local or a vacationer.",

It would take you that long in any food line, especially since they closed like 1/3 of snack bars, and other eateries. So good options are extremely limited. They of course say nothing up front that they are running the park this way. \n\nIf you have any hopes of riding more than one coaster and eating more than one meal, get ready to spend half of your time in lines. \n\nWaste of time, money, and energy.

      "text": "Busch Gardens is a big shocker for the unexpected. I had a idea that the park was big but not till my trip here did I really get a personal up close encounter of the rides and the animals. I came here on mlk day and what a day to pick to come. The park was empty I was a little nervous on it being packed with kids not having school. I got there around 11am and stayed till around 6:30pm being the park was about to close at 7pm. \n\nAs far as my actual first impression goes I loved how the park offers so many different ride choices. I want with some close friends who know the park well so I was able to be shown the best features of the park. I rode all the major rides being about 9 coasters my favorite being the cheetah hunt. The lines for rides I was impressed because the park was not busy and I only waited about 20 to 35 minuets per a ride. My longest wait was around a hour being the ride had some technical issues. Me and my group did check out some of the animals but we spent more time on the rides so I can't say much on that aspect. \n\nNow as far as cost goes I don't think it's worth it not even close. If your a Florida resident you can go all year just by paying a 1 time fee of around $100 bucks. But for a normal family of 4 just to come for 1 day your looking at over $400 dollars not including on the high cost of food and drinks. But yes high cost of food and drinks are expected for a amusement park but that upfront cost of the ticket is brutal. I understand your getting rides and animals in one but I think a more understandable price would be around 59.99 for a one ticket for a non Florida resident. \n\nOverall I can't imagine what a hot summer day would be like here and how crowded it gets. I would return to Busch Gardens again in the future but I wish they took there pricing into consideration for out of state residents.",

One of our favorite things to do at Busch Gardens is to get on the train that takes you throughout the park because you have a really great view of the animals in the safari area.

When we got to the park, at the 2nd entrance (once you've paid and entered with your ticket) there is a sign that lists all the rollercoasters that are not not in service for the day. There was 4 listed. REALLY? Four... not counting Gazi. There are only 9 in total and technically 5 were not working?!?! \n\nNow, I 100% get there are probably major reasons for them to be down that include safety but that just seems insane to me that they would still charge full price for less than half of the rollercoasters which is the only reason we were there and why most people are. Yes, it may not bother some but that is just crazy. It is not a cheap place to go, especially per person. \n\nOn a plus note, I did enjoy seeing all the lights and decorations that were out for Christmas. They were beautiful.",

I think this place is special because it is not as packed as the Orlando theme parks but you can still have a lot of fun here.  They do a lot of things right here.  If you have a double seated stroller with more than 1 little kid, you can park closer to the front entrance.  They have stroller parking for family members, which is great.  If you do not park in the stroller area they have open air shuttles that will transport you to and from the parking lot.  \n\nThey have a very nice train that stops by the different 4 stops every 15 minutes.  If you stay on the train and do the full loop it takes about 45 to 1 hour. The train is awesome and the conductors do a great job in telling you about animal's and rides that you are passing by.  \n\nThe entrance plaza is nice and they offer all day dining so if you have a big family I would highly recommend this for the day that you are there.  You can also get a drink cup and have refills for .99 cents all year. \n\nThey have plenty of coasters, water rides, and kids rides.  They have a very large kids play area where you can have a lot of fun.  If your kid has sensory issues they have a sensory park which is great for kids to play on.  \n\nThrough out the year they have a lot of other events going on from Halloween to Christmas!! Also they serve AB Beer and hard alcohol here at this park and you can enjoy a drink or two here as well.  \n\nI highly recommend Busch Gardens!!!",

The sky ride was always the height of the day for all. So memorable!  The train was not running. A lot of the animal could be viewed. Paid for the food plan but were great full that we only bought 4. The food was awful, cold and nasty. We understand you could not control weather but it seemed to not make sense. The games and such could run but not the merry go round. Stood inline to see if we could get a refund because we were so disappointed, but after row hours left. Grand children were crying, disappointed and miserable!

      "text": "We haven't been to Busch Gardens since a Hawl-O-Scream visit several years ago and were looking forward to attending the park during their annual Christmas Town Event (Nov 12 thru Jan 2). As I mentioned in my recent review of SeaWorld Orlando, on Black Friday 2021, we purchased our SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Tampa two park pass (for two) totaling $131.98, definitely a great deal!\n\nSeaWorld is the parent company to Busch Gardens, so my 3-complaints from my SeaWorld review remain. (1) $30 parking is expensive, why not include this into the cost of the ticket? (2) Food and drink prices can be excessive, $10.99 for a beer, $4.70 for bottled water, $6 for a cookie WTF? (3) once again, no paper map. Guests must use a QR code to download a map or take a photo at the entrance, then continuously use your phone to navigate the park, this is beyond frustrating. Do yourself a favor and download the map from their website and print a copy or two to take with you.\n\nBusch Gardens has a good variety of rides to choose from, and they are all a blast. Unfortunately, on this occasion, Skyride, Congo River Rapids, Cheetah Hunt, and Kumba were closed for repair. In addition, Falcon's Fury closed early, Montu closed down due to heavy rainfall (of course, as were we next in line), and the Iron Gwazi does not open until March 2022. As you can see, we didn't have the best run with roller coasters on this visit, but we still had fun on Tigris, Cobra's Curse, Sheikra, and the Stanley Falls Flume.\n\nI enjoyed that Busch Gardens has a balanced selection of rides, animal encounters, and activities to choose from. There is a lot to do here for anyone, and you can easily spend an entire day exploring. We came for the whole Christmas experience, and it was beautiful, but some of the Festive Shows, such as the 'Christmas on Ice,' were not offered because we came on a Tuesday.\n\nWe were not too impressed with the food at Busch Gardens, but if you can wait until Christmas Town opens at dark (6 pm) you have an opportunity to try some of the better food the park has to offer by purchasing one of the two food and beverage sampler packages available. The 8-option is $44.99 & the 12-option is $64.99. Just know that if you order a beer, it is served in what looks to be about 8oz cup, yet the food looks better than many other options we viewed/sampled throughout the day.\n\nMy two cents on the Nairobi Train Station's Serengeti Express: Ride the train during the day when you can actually see the animals. We went at nighttime thinking we would see a magnificent light show, but all you see is pitch black darkness until you get back. The best part of the whole ride was when everyone started howling like wolves once inside the tunnel.\n\nSomething to note: Elmo's Christmas Wish is the same storyline as the one at SeaWorld and is performed outside in the Sesame Street section of the park. The show is adorable, and the kids seem to love it. You can sit very close to the stage, and the characters will do a photo op with kids/adults after the show. There is also a large playground/jungle gym nearby for kids to play while waiting for the show to start. Nancy and I got in there and had so much fun!\n\nOnce again, some minor issues here, just like SeaWorld, but nothing I would consider a deal-breaker, especially since we got such a fantastic deal on our tickets. If you have never been to Busch Gardens or if you are looking for something fun to do in Tampa, I highly recommend a visit here; however, look around for deals online through Groupon or AAA.com.",

      "text": "The park is incredible; beautiful landscaping, incredible sights, and an awesome collection of rides and shows. \n\nI went on a busy Wednesday in the middle of December, and the park was decently busy. However, the first issue with this place isn't even in the park itself, but rather the parking lot. I've visited some prestigious parks, such as Six Flags Great America, Cedar Point, and the parks of Disney World. Something all of these parks have in common is that they have mastered getting people into and out of the parking lot. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, sadly, has a terrible setup, and the line to get into the park moves atrociously slow, and, if the line gets long enough, it can slow down traffic. This was my first of many major complaints.\n\nWe walked into the park and visited Cheetah Hunt, an awesome launched roller coaster with incredible sights. The line got pretty long, but it was nothing o complain about. We then stopped by an eatery across the path called Oasis Pizza. The pizza was alright, but what wasn't was the hour wait to even order food. Food service is NOT this park's strength. While the employees are awesome, their speed is not. \n\nWe then took the train to Stanleyville, rode some attractions there and at the Congo area, and then visited Pantopia. The first thing we did here was the acclaimed Falcon's Fury, which was an awesome ride. However, this is where my biggest complaint comes in.\n\nOnly two members of my group wished to ride. As we were approaching the front of the line, a ride operator asked for a group of two. We immediately began walking to the front. A man in front of us then raised his hand and started to get his daughter from outside to join him. The other member of my group said that this was not fair, and that she had never entered the line, which everyone in front of us agreed with. The man then began to shove them, in front of small children, his daughter, and his wife, and scream that he had every right to bring her on the ride. The ride operator then \"explained\" that if it was just one person, he couldn't do anything. This was then followed by many people in line protesting by asking if they could bring just one person in line. I do not wish to express anger to the ride operator, nor the man's daughter. However, I am very disturbed that the man thought that he could get away with it and at whoever in charge decided this was okay. \n\nWe then continued to ride attractions until we visited Cobra's Curse. This is a fun attraction that had a decent looking queue line. However, the way the skip-the-line queue was being operated led to the stand-by line not moving for 20 minutes at one time.\n\nI do not seek a refund or anything of the sort.\n\nI only seek for a reform of policies and rules in order for future guests to enjoy their time.\n\nI hoped that I'd be impressed and would want to visit again, but after this experience, I have no desire to return any time in the near future.",

I waited in line for their wild mouse \"Sand Serpent\" roller coaster for 1 hour. Kids were seen cutting through lines, hanging from handrails, falling into others in line, etc and there was no one around to correct this. For twice the price of a reputable amusement park (I.e Cedar Point), I feel awfully jipped. Their main ride, Cheetah Hunt was also down when I was here.",

This is the park that my husband has been waiting to go to forever... and I was so happy to be able to take him.\n\nSo getting there wasn't bad and the parking wasn't the greatest - since we had to park on the other side of the park where you have to take a tram to get to the entrance of the park - but we made the best of it.\n\nWe get thru security and showing our tickets to get in and we thought that the adventure was going to begin... like at Sea World... but low-and-behold, we were so surprised to find that you have to walk so much before you even see anything! What?!? \n\nWe see a ride coming up and notice that it's not running... come to find out that it's not even finished yet! Ugh! \n\nMore walking it is...\n\nSo we come upon some areas that have some beautiful flowers and topiary... loved it. But no more... we had to walk even more to find an area with the kangaroo and further down, some birds. \n\nWhere the heck are the rides in this joint?!?! \nFound Sesame Street area found... our daughter got in one ride there and we walked out. \n\nMore walking and we finally find some rides but at this point - almost an hour in and we hadn't found a concession stand to get anything to drink and mind you, it's like 90\u00b0 while walking! There were about 5/6 concession stands and restaurants that we passed that were just closed.\n\nSo we had to stop to get a drink at the first concession stand we found that when we got in line, only one of the registers were being used and the line was super long!\nWe finally got our drinks and snacks, ate them and decided to jump into the line of the first water ride we see. Score!\n\nNo score...\nAfter waiting over an hour and a half, the employees come over the PA system to tell us that the ride was shutting down because it was broken but we were more than welcome to stand in line until it was fixed! What?!?! Why would I continue staying in line for a ride that was completely shut down?!\n\nSo we get out of line and were just disappointed with the whole experience. There were barely employees around to help with answering questions, which was very strange to see.\n\nThe layout of the park was so strange... I don't know how to explain it but it wasn't easy to read the maps that they have in order to get around.\n\nSo we decided to leave the park - and thank goodness we did when we did because a storm came ripping thru the park - and we got to the area where you get on the tram and come to find out that the park had stopped the running of the tram because of the storm that was coming. And they weren't going to start them up again for 45 minutes! What?!?! You bring your patrons from across another parking area that isn't close by on your tram and now we have to walk to the other side - thru a long tunnel and cars whizzing by and falling branches from palm trees, no less! Busch Gardens... do you not care about the safety of your patrons!!!???\n\nSo... that's the end of our adventure at Busch Gardens. I felt that it was a waste of time and money... even though the hubby says he'll give it another try one day - maybe never for me.",

So I got their military deal, then the meal deal, but not the fast pass because if I was not military the ticket $90, meal $34 and weekend fast pass $65 would of been over 200 a person and this isn't universal or Disney you know. Don't get me wrong I do really like this place, that's just really really expensive. \n\nThe rides were pretty fun. I've been to like 20 amusement parks and their rides are in top 6. The staff was friendly and helpful and worked with me well when my kid didn't want to ride the coaster and let me hang out while my other kid rode. \n\nThey could really improve by adding more things in their line than just the line game. The newer rides have started to take advantage of this, but the older rides is straight line game and the log drop is so narrow lines that I had to stand and walk sideways the whole time. \n\nGotta appreciate the charging stations, cell phone charging cells and free WiFi. That's always a bonus. \n\nI would always come back here if in the area.",

Almost no concessions open (the ones that were open were gross and still absurdly priced). Skeleton staff.  Many rides shutdown. Some of the big coasters were open but only large children and adults can ride them.  They apparently aren't even printing maps of the park anymore. Honestly, it borders on fraud to allow people to buy tickets without telling them they are simply buying an expensive ticket for an open-air walk.  It's just a cruddy partial zoo now.",

If you love animals you will get a lot out of it. If you are expecting good food, there is only really one place I would recommend.  There is a barbecue smokehouse at the back of the park that is fantastic, but all the other food and snacks that we had with their unlimited dining program was frankly horrific. I had one of the worst pulled pork sandwiches of my life that tasted like salty rubber and even the funnel cake that I had tasted like Burnt dough and old cooking oil. They kept advertising that there would be Rudolph the red nose reindeer and related character meet and greets, which never happened and was very disappointing to me. Their Christmas village was basically pretty lights, some decent singers/performers, and the rest was just a glorified flea market/shopping mall. It was a pretty basic experience but I enjoyed The time with my family there which I guess is what really matters :-)",

The rides are more intense than Disney world and in my opinion, more fun. There is so much to do; Busch gardens is also a safari and it has animal exhibits all around the park that even go along with the rides! For example, next to the ride \"cheetah hunt\" is a real cheetah enclosure! They even have a kids camp so kids can stay in Busch gardens after hours and sleep there for a night. I  wouldn't recommend going with someone who does not love roller coasters because many of them are thrill rides. Even so, they all ride smoothly and feel safe while you're on them. \nMy only complaint would be that while I was there, some of the rides had to be stopped for a couple hours and made the waits very very long.",

Once 4 pm hit a tremendous influx of people seemed to be entering, guessing for the Christmas Town foods for purchase and the related festivities? \n       Plenty to stay busy with, lots of walking (wear your best comfy walking shoes)! Food prices are up everywhere and amusement park food and beverage prices are always high. We opted for the all day dining wristbands which was $44 per person, but once we saw water priced at about $4/bottle and all food prices hefty we knew the bands were the way to go since staying til close. There are certain eateries the meal bands work at so investigate that via the Busch Gardens app. \n      We'd all 4 say only eat at the Smokehouse place if getting pulled pork or the chicken. The ribs and the brisket were so extremely fatty it was a bust! They also threw all the meats from a sampler platter atop the waffle fries that come with the sampler therefore creating soggy, cold, bbq sauced waffle fries.  We found the large indoor Dragon Fire Grill & pub for dinner and it offers several fast counter service places to choose from plus beverage stations. This worked well and was conveniently located and had tons of seating.\n     Ride lines were reasonable from opening time til about 3 or 4 pm when a huge influx of people seemed to enter the park leading to super crowded walkways, seating areas outdoors, and much longer lines for many coasters. A special Christmas Town list of festivities and foods began at 4 we think. The festive foods are exorbitantly priced and appeared to be mere samples. The park sells 12 samples of Christmas Town \"specialties\" at a separate price if $40 something per person. We hardly saw anyone partaking in this but it's there.",

It was huge, it was eye-catching, it was exciting, it was fun! It didn't even feel like a theme park, but more like a fun festival of some sort. (And it was probably expensive, but my parents handled that.)\n\nBusch Gardens has a ton of awesome rides, but for some reason, I will never forget the Scorpion roller coaster. It's just a small red roller coaster, but the cool thing about it is the one loop that goes upside down. Here's the kicker: you're not harnessed in with anything extra beyond the seatbelt and lap bar. I was a bit freaked out but it turned out to be pretty fun.\n\nI really hope I go back again at some point in the near future.

      "text": "It's like if you were to combine carowinds and a really cool zoo. Everything is clean and kept up with. The animals look healthy and happy for the most part. \n\nThere is a petting zoo with kangaroos and birdies that you can feed and pet. There are also two aviaries that you can walk through. One of them you can buy a tiny cup of juice and the lorikeets will land on you and be your best buddy until the juice is gone. Be warned though birds like to perch and give little love bites.\n\nThere are elephants, lions, a cheetah, a tiger, and a bunch of other animals. Pretty much everywhere there isn't a shop or a ride there is more zoo. It's the best use of space I've ever seen in an amusement park.\n\nThe rides are fun and well maintained. The queue system is a bit odd. There is a quick queue ticket line and the regular line but once you get to the end of the line it's kind of a free for all. I was surprised at how well behaved the other park goers were even though it was a mix of different languages and cultures everyone waited their turn respectfully, with one exception. \n\nThere was one jerk who tried to use the express line without a pass and the attendant was nice to him. When he started to yell at her she turned very sarcastic while still being very professional. When he finally gave up she apologized to us and we went on our merry way. It was neat to see someone remain cool under that kind of pressure.\n\nAt night around 5 parts of the park closed but it was lit up for Christmas. The train ride changed to a sing along Carol train. From Skyride cable cars you can pretty much see all of the lights and pretty decorations. Kiddy area is also all decked out.\n\nThis park gave me so much to do that I forgot to take pictures and check in. It was overwhelming and amazing and this is probably my favorite amusement park now. I'm a sucker for birds though so I might be a bit bias.",

I chose to come during the week because it would be a little less crowded.  We got there and immediately started doing some of the rides.  The lines were not that long, some waits were only about 10 minutes.  One of the new things they offer was the Serengeti Safari.  We met in a designated spot 15 minutes before the start of the tour.  They will explain what will happen, then they ask you to put your belongings in a locker.  After they walk you to the area where a truck is waiting for you.  This is a standing tour, you will stand in the bed of the truck for the whole tour.  It was awesome.  You see some of the animals very closely and we even fed and petted a giraffe.  How awesome is that.  I love the Congo River rapids ride, it's the big yellow one that seats about 12 people.  This ride used to be a little drier back in the day, but now, people can wet you from the sides while you pass.  My friends' thought they were going to end up dry, however almost at the end of the ride got soaked.  It was so much fun.  I don't do roller coasters, but my husband and my little girl did Kumba, which is one of the worst.  Even my girlfriend, who loves them said that this one leaves you rattled.  Yikes!  My little boy and I stayed safe and sound on firm land.  There was so much to do, we were not able to do everything, you probably need a couple of days at least to do most.  We were there for 7 of the 8 hours they are open.",

Good idea, terrible execution...they took everyone at the back of the line (who just arrived and hadn't been waiting for 50 mins) and put them in the new line.  Every single person who had already waited 50 mins had to wait an extra 20 mins while these folks who just showed up waited 5 or 10 and got their food.  We were so frustrated!",

      "text": "If you're for thrill rides, Busch Gardens will not disappoint. \n\nWe purchased a fun pass back in July when we visited & was able to use it once during our stay, which is good until the end of the year. We did this because we planned to come back during the holidays to use it again, so we were able to get 2 more uses out of it. \n\nParking is $30, unless you have some sort of annual pass where general parking is covered. You then get in line for a shuttle to bring you to the park from the parking lot, but honestly, sometimes just walking to the park without the shuttle will get you there even faster, especially when it's crowded & lines are long. They could use a few more of these shuttles to keep the lines & waits shorter. \n\nLines can be long & hectic, so best to plan accordingly. We didn't look into it, but I believe you can purchase some sort of fast queue to shorten or bypass the general line. Not sure how this works, or how much, but info should be listed on their site. I do know they have limited quantities on this. So if you're short on time, or just don't want to wait in the long lines, you may want to take advantage of this. \n\nWe've rode Cheetah Hunt, which is our favorite so far. We even got to ride it one evening where they did the fireworks show, so it was a great experience to ride this while fireworks were going in the background. \n\nWe've also rode Montu. For some reason, this ride is usually our first ride of the day & then we just make our way through the rest of the park. Tigris was also fun & we have tried to ride Cobra's curse 3x on all 3 different occasions, but either there is always maintenance going on, or the line was over 2 hrs. \n\nMost of the times aren't always accurate. I feel like we get through the line faster than what is displayed. \n\nWe also enjoy disneyworld, but when it comes to thrill rides, I highly recommend Busch Gardens. \n\nI heard Iron Gwazi is being built & should be open to ride sometime in March of 2022 & will be known as North America's tallest hybrid coaster & the fastest & steepest hybrid coaster in the WORLD!",

They have all sort of things for everyone in the family---kiddie rides and Sesame Street area for youngsters, roller coasters for thrill seekers, train rides, ice show, animal safari encounters, animal viewing and educational areas. They even cater to school field trips. The park is so big that you could spend a full day there. They have shuttles available to take you to and from the park to the parking lot. Handicap and stroller parking available. Food is just ok with plenty of options. They have a good stuffed pretzel place and bbq place. But other options are just typical theme park food quality. They also are good about doing monthly promotions for pass holders. \n\nWe've gone on the animal safari before which is an additional cost on top of annual pass or regular admission but reasonable. And it's quite the adventure. They take you out on a safari truck and you can actually feed the giraffes! Amazing experience and highly recommend this. Including so pictures of that. \n\nRating 4 stars as I'd like to see the restrooms cleaner. They tend to smell like they mop the floors with urine.",

BG is also significantly more fun than Disney.\n\nBG doesn't have the amount of thrill rides that Cedar Point does, but no park in the country can claim that.\n\nBG also has a freakin zoo, and cool events like Howl-O-Scream and Christmas Town.\n\nI don't really know what I was thinking with my original review.",

All things said and done it was definitely not enjoyable.  \n\nWe arrived half an hour before the park opened and traffic was snarled in every direction.  It took well over an hour to get into the parking lot.  By that time most people around suffered from various forms of road rage and anxiety issues.  We had preferred parking so we didn't have to do the tram thing.  \n\nThe flow was heavy going into the park but security did a good job of getting everyone through at a good rate.  We grabbed a beer and headed to the nearest roller coaster.  The Montu line wasn't too bad.  45 minutes.   Over to the cobras curse for an hour and 45 minute wait.  The only thing making it bearable were the air-conditioned portions of the line.  \n\nHeaded to the dragon fire grill and the lines were horrible.  The food court was jam packed with people.  We chose from the Oriental bar and nothing was remarkable or impressive.   Thank goodness it's owned by a beer company and you can find beer around every corner.\n\nWe headed for the Shiekra and then the sound that you never want to hear sounded in the background.  Thunder.   Yup.  It took about 15 minutes and the only ride left open was the carousel.  The radar looked like it might slide by so we found some cover (with a beer of course) and waited for the rain which never happened.   \n\nBoredom persisted so we went to go view the animals.   Halfway through our walk we heard the announcement that the rides would not be reopened.  To the parking lot we all went.\n\nAfter spending alot of money on tickets, AirBnB , etc....  We got to ride four rides, eat lacklustre food, pay for overpriced beer, all in the midst of Lord knows how many thousand angry, agitated, and ornery people.  It just wasn't a positive experience for me.  Hopefully you'll have better luck. \n\nThanks for the read click a button below and let me know what you thought.",

That said, Busch Gardens has vastly improved over the years.\n\nWhile Disney ticket prices have increased Busch Garden tickets have decreased dramatically.  You can now get a season pass for practically the same price as a day pass!  Busch Gardens most recent additions have been the Shiekra roller coaster, Cheetah Hunt roller coaster, Rhino Ralley, more shows, and more animals.\n\nMy favorite roller coasters are the Kumba and the Montu so I always try to ride them at the beginning of the day so I can avoid the long lines.  As I get older the Shiekra gives me panic attacks and I can no longer ride it, but if you are a thrill seeker you will love it!  The Cheetah Hunt is one of the more tame roller coasters and I can usually convince my mom to ride with me.  AVOID THE GWAZI!!!!  This is the worst ride in the park and will toss you around until you either get a headache or throw up.  Chiropractic adjustments are required after you ride!!!!  If you must ride this roller coaster save it for the end of the day or you will feel terrible for the rest of the day at the park.\n\nFor the 21+ adults there is a fun Busch beer class.  The class is about an hour long and you get to try a ton of free beer samples.  \n\nI only think Busch Gardens will get better over the years.  They own a ton of land that they haven't developed yet so they can easily double the size of the park when they are ready.",

      "text": "The park should be investigated for criminal behavior. They charge full price but do not disclose that more than half of the park's rides and restaurants are closed. They pack more people in than the park can accommodate at current service level. \nOn the website, they show two rides down for maintenance, but once you get in, you'll find that only two roller coasters are running, and they have 160-190 minutes wait time. We wanted to take the train through the zoo. We waited for over three hours to get on. By the time we got on the train, it was dark. The train operator joked that we won't get to see anything, it's basically just a form of transportation now.\nOn the website it states you can eat at six+ restaurants with your meal deal, but once in the park, you'll find that only 1 restaurant is open and it has two-hour wait time for a soggy slice of pizza.\nWe were unable to see any shows, people were lined up to see the show after the next show. No thanks.\nThis park is a hellish nightmare. I would not go again if it was free.",

      "text": "So, here's the thing. If you have grown up in Southern California and been a frequent visitor of the San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Wild Animal park, then the \"zoo\" aspect of Busch Gardens is pretty lacking. And if you have grown up going to Disneyland and Magic Mountain, then the roller coaster aspect of Busch Gardens is also pretty lame, as nothing is \"themed\" out at all and the coasters aren't as good. So, compared to these other parks, Busch Gardens is mediocre at best. If you have NOT been to these other parks, then it will probably seem pretty cool. \n\nI was also little surprised at the cost (especially considering the fact that this park is so mediocre) - $77 per adult ticket, plus a $5 fee per person (WTF?). That is on top of the $13 for parking. That puts them at $6 more per ticket than Disneyland and $43 MORE per ticket than the San Diego Zoo. WAY overpriced. And the park isn't even that big. So, we were pretty disappointed.",
